By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower (no requirements needed, it simply takes effect). Alternatively, you can create effects beyond the scope of normal spells: create a nonmagical object of up to 25,000 gp in value, up to 300 feet in any dimension; up to 20 creatures regain all HP and end all effects on them as described in greater restoration; grant up to 10 creatures resistance to a chosen damage type; grant up to 10 creatures immunity to a single spell or effect for 8 hours; or undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round. Using wish for anything other than duplicating a spell causes stress: 2d10 necrotic damage per spell level when casting (minimum STR of 3, or you can't cast spells for 2d4 days), and there is a 33% chance you are unable to cast wish ever again.", "classes": ["Sorcerer", "Wizard"] }
