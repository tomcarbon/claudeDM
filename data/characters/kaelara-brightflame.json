  "appearance": "A tall, athletic woman of 5'10\" with warm bronze skin and close-cropped black hair. Her dark brown eyes radiate calm determination. She wears polished chain mail over robes of white and gold, with the sunburst symbol of Lathander displayed prominently on her shield. Faint burn scars on her hands speak of hours tending sacred flames.",
  "backstory": "Kaelara was left at the Temple of the Morninglord as an infant, wrapped in a blood-stained soldier's cloak. Raised by the priests, she showed an early aptitude for divine magic and a fierce protective instinct for the other orphans. When plague struck a nearby village and the temple elders debated whether to intervene, Kaelara gathered supplies and marched out alone, saving a dozen lives through prayer and sheer stubbornness. Her superiors recognized both her gift and her willfulness, and sent her into the world to serve Lathander where the need is greatest."
