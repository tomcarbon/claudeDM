  "appearance": "A wiry halfling of 3'2\" with messy chestnut hair, bright green eyes, and a crooked grin that never quite reaches his eyes. He wears dark, well-worn leather armor with numerous hidden pockets. A thin scar crosses the bridge of his nose, and his nimble fingers are never still, always fidgeting with a coin or lockpick.",
  "backstory": "Bramble grew up on the streets of Waterdeep's Dock Ward after his family's produce cart was destroyed in a turf war between rival guilds. Taken in by a fence named Old Copper Kess, he learned the arts of burglary and pickpocketing before he was tall enough to reach a door handle. After a job went sideways and his mentor was arrested, Bramble skipped town with the guild's cut, and now stays one step ahead of both the law and the people he once called family."
