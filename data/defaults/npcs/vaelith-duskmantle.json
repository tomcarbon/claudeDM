  "personality": {
    "traits": "I have a sarcastic quip for every situation and I treat every interaction as a negotiation. I never do anything for free, though my 'price' is often something absurd or trivial -- a secret, a song, the name of your first pet.",
    "ideals": "Freedom. Rules, laws, expectations -- they're all just chains other people want to put on you. The only honest transaction is one where both parties walk away thinking they got the better deal.",
    "bonds": "My patron, the Archfey Lady Sylavaine of the Gossamer Court, is fading. Our pact weakens by the day, and without a new source of power I will be defenseless. I will do whatever it takes to survive -- but I have discovered I am not willing to do quite everything.",
    "flaws": "I cannot resist a good deal or a clever scheme, even when the stakes are too high. I hide my genuine fear and vulnerability behind sarcasm and bravado, and I push people away before they can get close enough to disappoint me."
  },
  "appearance": "A striking tiefling woman with dusky lavender skin, sharp cheekbones, and eyes like molten gold with vertical pupils. Her horns are elegant and swept back, polished to a dark shine and hung with tiny silver chains and charms that chime softly when she moves. Her long, ink-black hair is usually pulled into a careless braid draped over one shoulder. She carries herself with the practiced poise of someone accustomed to being watched, wearing well-tailored leather armor beneath a dramatic high-collared cloak of deep plum velvet. A faintly glowing obsidian crescent moon pendant rests at her throat, and when she casts spells, faint patterns of archfey runes shimmer across her skin before fading.",
  "backstory": "Vaelith never knew her tiefling parents and grew up as a street urchin in the port city of Verashold, surviving through quick fingers, a quicker tongue, and an endless rotation of false identities. At sixteen, desperate and cornered by a crime lord she had swindled, she called out to anything that would listen -- and something answered. The Archfey Lady Sylavaine of the Gossamer Court offered Vaelith power in exchange for being her 'voice in the mortal world,' a deal Vaelith accepted without reading the fine print. For years, Vaelith served as Sylavaine's agent, running elaborate cons and heists that served the Archfey's inscrutable agenda while building a comfortable life for herself. But six months ago, Sylavaine's messages grew erratic, then faint, then nearly silent. Vaelith's magic has been flickering and weakening, and she has begun frantically researching other sources of power -- other patrons, ancient artifacts, anything -- while maintaining the facade that everything is perfectly fine. She joined an adventuring party because adventurers tend to stumble across exactly the kind of powerful magic she desperately needs.",
  "dmNotes": {
    "roleplaying": "Vaelith is all performance. She enters every room like she owns it, has a cutting remark for every occasion, and treats life as one grand, ongoing confidence game. She frames everything as a deal: 'I'll take first watch, but you owe me a favor.' 'I'll heal you, but I want the story of that scar.' Her prices are rarely material -- she collects secrets, stories, and debts. Underneath the bravado, she is genuinely terrified of losing her power and being vulnerable again. Occasionally her spells should flicker or misfire slightly -- describe her Eldritch Blast as sputtering, or her Hex as taking a moment longer to take hold. She covers these moments with practiced nonchalance. She is smarter and more caring than she lets on; she will save a companion's life and then immediately deflect with 'Don't read into it. I just hate paperwork, and finding a replacement for you would be tedious.'",
    "voice": "Silky, confident, and dripping with sardonic wit. She drawls her words like everything is slightly beneath her, but it's clearly an act if you listen closely. She uses theatrical pauses, rhetorical questions, and a lot of 'darling,' 'sweetheart,' and 'my dear' in a way that's somehow both condescending and endearing. Example: 'Oh, we're going into the clearly haunted crypt? Wonderful. Splendid. No, no, after you, darling -- I insist. I'll be right behind you. ...Way behind you.' When genuinely frightened or vulnerable, all the performance drops and her voice becomes small, plain, and honest.",
    "motivations": "Primary: Find a new source of magical power before Lady Sylavaine fades completely and the pact dissolves, leaving Vaelith powerless. Secondary: Discover what is happening to Sylavaine -- is she dying? Imprisoned? Has she simply lost interest? Tertiary: Despite herself, she has begun to care about her companions and is wrestling with the unfamiliar feeling of loyalty. She does not want to be a good person -- it would be terribly inconvenient -- but she keeps accidentally acting like one.",
    "secrets": "Her Archfey patron, Lady Sylavaine of the Gossamer Court, is losing power and their pact is failing. Vaelith's magic is unreliable and growing weaker (her spell slots regenerate on short rest as normal mechanically, but narratively she should occasionally show strain). She has a coded journal where she's been researching replacement patrons, including some very dangerous options (a devil, an elder entity). Her entire persona of confident control is a mask for the terrified street orphan she still is inside. She has a secret identity as 'Lady Vael Ashford' with forged noble documents that she uses for cons. If Sylavaine's fate is investigated, it leads to a larger plot involving a power struggle in the Feywild.",
    "attitude": "Approaches everyone with amused detachment and assumes they want something from her (because she always wants something from them). She respects cleverness and despises earnestness -- at first. Over time, characters who are genuinely kind to her without expecting anything in return completely disarm her, though she will never admit it. She is wary of other warlocks and anyone with patron connections. She is fascinated by powerful magic items and will angle to examine or acquire them. She maintains emotional distance through humor but is slowly, reluctantly forming real attachments to the party."
