  "appearance": "A lithe, graceful half-elf of 5'7\" with tousled dark auburn hair, one green eye and one amber eye, and an easy, disarming smile. Their features blend human warmth with elven sharpness. They wear a deep emerald leather jacket over their armor, adorned with silver embroidery, and carry a beautifully carved rosewood lute across their back.",
  "backstory": "Born to an elven bard and a human merchant in a bustling port city, Zephyr learned early that a clever word could open more doors than a crowbar. When their mother vanished under mysterious circumstances, their father grew distant, and Zephyr took to the tavern circuit, trading songs for coin and secrets for favors. Their performances are legendary in at least three cities -- as are the hasty departures that followed certain romantic entanglements with people of influence."
