  "backstory": "Thorin served for decades in the Ironforge clan's shield wall, defending the mountain holds against goblinoid raids and worse. After a devastating attack left his company shattered and his captain slain, Thorin took up his fallen leader's battleaxe and swore an oath to carry the fight beyond the mountain walls. Now he wanders the surface world, seeking worthy causes and worthy foes in equal measure."
