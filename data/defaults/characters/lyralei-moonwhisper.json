  "appearance": "A slender elf of 5'9\" with silver-white hair that falls to her waist and pale violet eyes that seem to shimmer faintly in low light. Her robes are deep midnight blue embroidered with constellations in silver thread, and her fingers are perpetually stained with ink. A crystal pendant around her neck pulses with a faint arcane glow.",
  "backstory": "Lyralei spent two centuries studying at the Moonwhisper Academy, a secluded elven library-fortress dedicated to preserving arcane knowledge. When she discovered a partially burned manuscript referencing a lost school of magic, her mentor encouraged her to venture into the wider world to find the remaining fragments. She left the academy's sheltered halls with more theoretical knowledge than practical experience, eager to test her spells against real challenges."
