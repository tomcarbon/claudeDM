  "appearance": "A towering, heavily muscled half-orc standing 6'4\" with grey-green skin criss-crossed with ritual scars and old battle wounds. His lower tusks jut prominently from a heavy jaw, and his deep-set yellow eyes burn with barely contained fury. His black hair is pulled into a topknot bound with leather cord, and he wears little armor, preferring to display the scars he considers trophies of survival.",
  "backstory": "Grimjaw was born to a small mixed tribe of orcs and half-orcs that lived in the Spine of the World mountains, surviving through hunting and raiding. When a rival warlord united several tribes and swept through the mountains, Grimjaw's people were annihilated in a single brutal night. He survived only because his mother threw him from a cliff into a river. After crawling from the frozen water miles downstream, he spent years alone in the wilderness, more beast than person, before drifting toward civilization's edges. He fights not for glory or gold, but because the rage inside him demands release.",
