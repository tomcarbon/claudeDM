    "description": "A quiet mountain hamlet nestled in a narrow valley, Whisperhollow was once a thriving dwarven mining settlement built around the legendary Ironvein Mine. The town has dwindled to a few dozen families who eke out a living from sheep herding and meager trade, haunted by the memory of the mine's sudden closure forty years ago. Strange echoes have begun reverberating from the sealed mine entrance at night, and the ground itself seems to hum with a deep, resonant vibration that rattles windowpanes and unsettles livestock.",
    "atmosphere": "A pervasive sense of forgotten grandeur and creeping unease hangs over the valley like morning fog that never quite burns away. The ruins of once-prosperous dwarven stonework peek through overgrown hillsides, and the wind through the valley carries faint sounds that could be distant singing or merely the groaning of old stone. At night, pale luminescence sometimes flickers behind the mine's sealed iron doors, visible from the village square.",

The party must navigate collapsed tunnels filled with vermin and animated mining equipment, solve ancient rune locks, cross a treacherous underground river, and ultimately face a shadow creature that was once the mine's last guardian, driven to madness by decades of lonely vigil.",

The ground shakes nightly, livestock refuse to graze near the old mine, and three villagers who went to investigate the noises two weeks ago have not returned.

The Heart of the Mountain pulses at the chamber's center, its golden light warm and inviting, but a creature of living shadow circles it endlessly, keening with a sound like grief given voice.",
          "readAloud": "\"The tunnel opens and the world falls away. You stand at the threshold of a cavern so immense it could hold a castle within its walls. Stalagmites as thick as ancient oaks have been carved into pillars depicting dwarven history — the forging of the first weapons, the founding of great halls, the discovery of something radiant in the deep dark. And there, at the chamber's heart, you see it: a crystalline geode the size of a warhorse, split open to reveal an interior blazing with warm golden light that pushes back the darkness like a miniature sun. Around it, a creature of pure shadow circles endlessly, its form shifting between something vaguely dwarven and something formless and anguished. It turns eyeless sockets toward you and releases a sound that is not a scream but a sob — ancient, exhausted, and utterly alone.\"",

It was once Thrain Stonemantle, who sacrificed his life to become an eternal guardian of the Heart. Decades of isolation have eroded his mind, leaving only the compulsion to protect and an overwhelming loneliness. If the party solves the rune lock, Thrain's spirit briefly manifests in his true dwarven form, thanks them, and asks them to tell his granddaughter Brenna that 'the vigil is kept, and the heart endures.'

The blue-silver veins in the walls pulse once, brilliantly, then settle into a steady, peaceful glow. The vibrations that shook Whisperhollow have stilled. As you make your way back through the tunnels, you notice the mine feels different — not threatening, but solemn, like walking through a cathedral after the congregation has gone.

In undeath, he is a tortured shadow, his form flickering between a vaguely dwarven silhouette and a shapeless darkness that weeps and rages in equal measure. Forty years of solitary guardianship have worn his mind to a razor's edge of instinct and anguish.",

His original devotion has curdled into something between duty and madness. He attacks intruders not out of malice but because he can no longer distinguish between threats and visitors. He longs for release but cannot abandon his post."

    "The animated mining equipment is not hostile — it is part of the mine's protective ward system, designed to coral intruders away from the Heart without killing them. The missing villagers were corralled, not attacked.",
    "The starsteel ore in the mine walls is connected to the Heart of the Mountain and could be worth a fortune, creating a temptation for the party: do they report its existence and risk the Heart's safety, or keep the secret?"
  ],
  "dmTips": [
    "Use sound design to build atmosphere throughout the adventure. The vibrations, the humming ore, the whispering bridge faces, and the shadow's keening should create a soundscape that shifts from ominous to melancholy as the true nature of the mine is revealed.",
    "If the party tries to remove the Heart of the Mountain, have the cavern begin to collapse immediately. This is not a treasure to be claimed but a sacred trust to be honored. Make this clear through environmental storytelling before they make the attempt.",
    "The rune lock puzzles can be simplified or made more complex depending on your group. At minimum, the party needs the passphrase from the bridge faces to resolve the final confrontation peacefully. If they missed that clue, allow Religion or History checks to reconstruct it from the carved pillars in the sanctuary.",
    "Thrain's shadow should be played sympathetically. Describe his attacks as desperate and confused rather than predatory. If a character speaks to him kindly or mentions Brenna's name, have the shadow hesitate for one round, giving the party a chance to try a non-combat solution.",
    "The three missing villagers serve as both a rescue objective and a source of information. They overheard the animated tools speaking fragments of Dwarvish and may have partial clues to the rune locks. Use them to feed hints to a stuck party without making the solutions feel handed to them."
