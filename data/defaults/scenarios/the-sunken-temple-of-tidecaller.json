    "description": "Brinewatch is a weathered fishing village perched on a rocky headland overlooking a stretch of coastline known for treacherous currents, hidden reefs, and an underwater shelf that drops into abyssal depths a mere half-mile from shore. The village has fished these waters for generations, but in the last month, the sea has been returning things it should have kept — strange coral-encrusted artifacts in the fishermen's nets, shredded netting that looks like it was cut by claws, and a growing sense that something enormous is shifting in the deep water beyond the shelf.",
    "atmosphere": "A raw, salt-scoured unease pervades Brinewatch, carried on winds that taste of brine and something older, like the breath of the ocean floor itself. The village's grey stone cottages huddle against the headland as if bracing for a wave that has not yet arrived, and the fishermen who still dare to go out return with haunted eyes and holds full of fish that have strange bite marks and luminous scales. At night, a faint green-blue glow is visible beneath the waves offshore, pulsing like a slow heartbeat from the direction of the underwater shelf.",

Sahuagin scouts have discovered the temple and are working to free their imprisoned master, believing they are performing a sacred duty. The party must navigate rising tides, slippery terrain, and underwater passages to reach the temple's heart and stop the sahuagin before the Tidecaller breaks free and unleashes catastrophic tidal forces on the coastline.",

The medallion depicts a humanoid figure wrapped in chains beneath ocean waves, and when Corwin touched it, he heard a voice in his mind — vast, ancient, and pleading for release. His nets were shredded by something in the water, his boat's hull bears claw marks from something that climbed aboard during the night, and three other Brinewatch fishermen have reported similar experiences. The village is offering 200 gold pieces in pooled savings to anyone who can discover what is happening beneath their waters and stop it before the fishing season — and the village — is ruined.",

The sahuagin tide priestess leads three warriors in a ritual to sever the chains, and the coral prison at the platform's center pulses with increasing intensity as the binding weakens. The Tidecaller stirs within, its movements sending waves across the flooded chamber.",

Water stretches in every direction — deep, black, and alive with currents that swirl around a raised stone platform at the chamber's center, connected to the corridor by a narrow stone causeway barely above the waterline. Chains of pure light stretch from the dome's walls to the platform, converging on a massive formation of living coral that pulses with each thrum of the heartbeat you have felt since entering the temple. Something moves within the coral — something immense, shifting with the slow patience of tides, pressing against its prison with inexorable force. On the platform, four figures work by the chains' glow: three sahuagin warriors and a fourth wearing a headdress of shells and bone — a priestess, her webbed hands tracing patterns of dissolution against the nearest chain, which flickers and dims with each pass. She turns at your approach, baring needle teeth in what might be a smile or a snarl, and hisses, 'You are too late, land-walkers. The Tidecaller wakes, and the sea will reclaim what was stolen.'\"",

In sahuagin theology, the Tidecaller is a divine messenger unjustly imprisoned by surface-dwellers who feared the sea's power.

It does not comprehend that its release would cause catastrophic tidal surges — it simply wants the pain of confinement to end.

If they weakened the prison, the coastline faces an escalating threat as the Tidecaller works toward its own release, and the party may need to find another way to deal with the situation before catastrophe strikes. The sahuagin will not forget the party's interference — surviving members of Vaalketh's cult will seek revenge or redouble their efforts at the temple. The ward medallion Corwin found may be the key to locating other chain-temples along the coast, suggesting this is merely the first chapter of a larger story about ancient imprisonments and the things the sea has been keeping."

    "The sahuagin are not random raiders but devout worshippers on a sacred mission to FREE their imprisoned deity's herald. Their actions are religiously motivated rather than predatory, making them antagonists with a sympathetic — if catastrophically dangerous — goal.",
    "The Tidecaller itself is not evil but simply too powerful and too confused by millennia of imprisonment to be safely released. Its freedom would cause catastrophic tidal surges not out of malice but simply as a natural consequence of its immense power moving through the ocean after an age of stillness.",
    "The artifacts the fishermen have been pulling from the sea are ward tokens — anchor points for the prison's magical binding chains. Their removal by tidal erosion and fishing nets has been slowly weakening the prison for years, meaning the current crisis is partly the villagers' own inadvertent doing."

  "dmTips": [
    "Use the rising tide as a persistent tension mechanic throughout the adventure. From the moment the party enters the tidal caves, keep them aware of the clock. Describe the water level rising incrementally in each scene — ankle-deep in the caves, knee-deep in the antechamber, waist-deep in the Hall of Currents, chest-deep during the escape. This natural timer creates urgency without requiring artificial pressure.",
    "The underwater and partially submerged combat is the adventure's unique challenge. Remind players that fighting in water deeper than waist height imposes disadvantage on melee weapon attacks (except for daggers, javelins, shortswords, spears, and tridents) and that ranged weapon attacks automatically miss beyond normal range. The sahuagin exploit these rules ruthlessly — make sure the players understand the tactical disadvantage they are operating under.",
    "The Tidecaller should be felt, not fought. Describe its presence through environmental effects — the water surging, the walls vibrating, a deep thrumming that the party feels in their bones. If a character touches the coral prison, give them a brief telepathic impression of the Tidecaller's emotional state: confusion, pain, loneliness, and a vast, unfocused yearning for the open ocean. This builds the moral complexity without requiring the party to face an enemy they cannot possibly defeat.",
    "The sahuagin tide priestess Vaalketh is the adventure's true antagonist, but she should not be played as a villain. She is a zealot performing what she believes is a holy act of liberation. If the party speaks to her, she explains her position with genuine conviction. She pities the surface-dwellers for their ignorance but does not hate them. This makes the confrontation more interesting than a simple fight against evil.",
    "If the party decides to free the Tidecaller instead of reinforcing the prison, do not prevent them — but show consequences immediately. The sea begins to churn as they escape, waves grow unnaturally large, and by the time they reach Brinewatch, a storm is building on the horizon that looks like nothing natural. This sets up a future adventure where the party must deal with the consequences of their choice, possibly by finding another way to communicate with or redirect the awakening Tidecaller."
