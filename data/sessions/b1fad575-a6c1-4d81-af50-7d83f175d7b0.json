Here's how to run it:\n- Drop the party at a random wilderness location on the Shattered Coast (choose from: Central Grasslands, Southern Plains, Northern Foothills, Western Crossroads, or Eastern Trail)\n- Describe the surrounding terrain, what the party can see on the horizon, and any immediate points of interest\n- The party can travel freely in any direction — there is no set quest or path\n- Scattered across the region are settlements and adventure locations (Saltmere, Thornfield, Whisperhollow, Brinewatch) that the party may discover through travel\n- When the party approaches a settlement, run its associated scenario storyline organically\n- Between settlements, improvise wilderness events: random encounters, weather, foraging, ruins, travelers, wildlife, and environmental storytelling\n- Use the exploration rules: each day of travel, consider weather, encounters, and discoveries\n- Let the player drive the direction — be a sandbox DM\n\nSet the opening scene now. Describe where the party wakes up, what they see, and what choices lie before them."

Just ash and a thin curl of smoke rising into the grey pre-dawn air.\n\nYou wake on hard-packed earth at the junction of two old roads — one running north-south, the other cutting east toward a distant smudge of coastline. The crossroads is marked by a leaning stone waypost, its carved letters worn nearly smooth by salt wind and time. You can just make out:\n\n> **NORTH — WHISPERHOLLOW (2 days)**\n> **SOUTH — THORNFIELD (1 day)**\n> **EAST — BRINEWATCH (2 days)**\n> **WEST — SALTMERE (1.5 days)**\n\nThe waypost is cracked down the middle. Someone has scratched a crude symbol beneath the directions — a circle with three jagged lines through it, like claw marks. The scratching looks recent.\n\nAround you, the landscape sprawls open and indifferent. **To the north**, the grasslands give way to low, scrubby hills that darken into wooded foothills. Something about the treeline looks wrong — too still, too uniform. **South**, the land flattens into golden-brown plains, and you can see what might be chimney smoke on the horizon. **East**, the road descends gradually toward the coast; the air carries the faint taste of brine. **West**, rolling grasslands stretch toward a distant haze that could be fog — or woodsmoke.\n\nPip is already up, crouched over a small cookfire he's coaxed to life from the embers, humming tunelessly. The smell of something involving wild herbs and hard biscuits drifts over.\n\n\"Morning, Bramble! Bit nippy, isn't it? I found some wood sorrel — gives the porridge a nice tang. Well, I say porridge. It's more of a... enthusiastic gruel.\" He grins. \"Still beats an empty belly.\"\n\nDrak stands at the edge of camp, facing north, one hand resting on his longbow. He hasn't moved in a while. Talon circles high above him in slow, patient arcs.\n\n\"...Didn't like the sounds last night,\" he says without turning. A pause. \"Something in those hills.\"\n\nMirael kneels in the dew-wet grass nearby, her fingers pressed to the earth, eyes closed. She opens them slowly. \"The land here is... tired. Old wounds beneath the surface. Scarred over but not healed.\" She looks at the waypost and frowns.\n\nVaelith emerges from her bedroll with theatrical displeasure, dark hair in disarray. \"Ah. Still here. Wonderful. I was hoping the crossroads was a bad dream and I'd wake up somewhere with walls and wine.\" She squints at the waypost. \"Four directions, four terrible options. How delightfully democratic. Anyone have a preference, or shall we just follow the screaming?\"\n\nEldon is examining the waypost with a magnifying lens, nose practically touching the stone. \"Pre-Sundering construction — see the jointing technique? Remarkable. And this symbol — three-line sigil, could be territorial marking, could be a warning glyph, could be someone's very angry grocery list. Hard to say without — oh, is that porridge? Lovely.\"\n\n**The morning is cool and overcast. A steady wind blows from the east, carrying salt air. No rain yet, but the clouds are low and heavy.**\n\n---\n\nThe road stretches in four directions, Bramble. The Shattered Coast is wide open.\n\n**What do you do?**"

I want to know what's in those hills.\"\n\n\"North it is!\" Pip chirps, already scraping porridge into wooden bowls and passing them around. \"Two days to Whisperhollow. Sounds cozy, doesn't it? Probably isn't. Places with 'hollow' in the name never are. But my gran always said, 'The scariest path usually has the best mushrooms.'\" He pauses. \"She was a strange woman.\"\n\nVaelith accepts her bowl with two fingers, as if it might bite her. \"Whisperhollow. Charming. I'm sure it's perfectly lovely and not at all full of things that whisper.\"\n\nMirael stands, brushing dirt from her knees, and looks toward the northern treeline. \"...The trees are listening,\" she says quietly. Then, to the group: \"We should stay on the road. And stay together.\"\n\nEldon is already packed, somehow, his oversized backpack clanking with what sounds like an entire tinker's workshop. \"Fascinating region, actually — the geological strata suggest significant magical disruption in the last century, possibly connected to the Sundering event that —\" He trips over a root. \"— I'm fine! Anyway, onward!\"\n\n---\n\n## The Road North — Morning\n\nThe party sets out along the north road. It's barely a road — two rutted cart tracks cutting through tall, whispering grass that rises to Bramble's shoulders. The wind bends it in slow waves, like the surface of a pale ocean.\n\nFor the first few hours, the going is easy. The overcast sky keeps the heat down. Drak takes point, Talon scouting ahead. Pip walks beside you, chattering about a recipe for dandelion wine. Mirael trails her fingers along the grass tops as she walks, murmuring something to herself.\n\nThen, around midday, Drak raises a fist. Everyone stops.\n\n\"Off the road. Fifty paces west.\" His voice is low. \"Cart. Overturned.\"\n\nYou peer through the grass. He's right. You can just make out the dark shape of a wagon lying on its side, one wheel still turning lazily in the wind. The grass around it is flattened in a wide circle — signs of a struggle.\n\nNo sound. No movement. Talon circles above the wreck but doesn't cry out.\n\nDrak looks back at you. Waiting.\n\nVaelith crosses her arms. \"Oh, this isn't suspicious at all, darling. Overturned cart in the middle of nowhere? Might as well have a sign that says 'AMBUSH' in big friendly letters.\"\n\nPip's smile has faded. His hands flex at his sides. \"...Could be someone needs help, though.\"\n\n---\n\n**The overturned cart sits fifty paces off the road to the west, in flattened grass. No visible movement. The wheel creaks in the wind.**\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**"

Did you eat something odd? Because that porridge was experimental, I'll admit, but —\"\n\nVaelith tilts her head. \"Darling. I admire the confidence. Truly. But if that's an ambush, you're going to be fighting it with nothing but enthusiasm and a draft.\"\n\nMirael simply says, \"No.\"\n\n**You think better of it.** The wind is cold, your leather armor is the only thing giving you AC 14, and whatever flattened that grass in a wide circle was *large*.\n\nYou keep your clothes on like a reasonable halfling.\n\n---\n\nThe cart still sits there. The wheel still creaks. Drak is still watching you, waiting for an actual plan.\n\n**What do you do?**"

You creep forward through the tall grass, dagger drawn, keeping low — which, being a halfling, comes naturally.\n\nLet me roll **Perception** for you as you approach, and **Stealth** to see how quietly you manage it.\n\n**Bramble — Stealth:** d20 + 5 (DEX +3, proficiency +2) = **18** *(rolled 13)*\n**Bramble — Perception:** d20 + 0 (WIS +0) = **14** *(rolled 14)*\n\nDrak also scans the area from the road:\n**Drak — Perception:** d20 + 3 (WIS +1, proficiency +2) = **19** *(rolled 16)*\n\n---\n\nYou move through the grass like a shadow. Not a single stalk bends wrong.\n\nHere's what you find:\n\nThe cart is a **merchant's wagon** — or was. It's been torn apart. Not overturned by accident. The wooden side panels are splintered outward, as if something *inside* burst out. Crates are scattered and smashed. Bolts of cheap cloth flutter in the wind. A barrel of salt has cracked open, spilling white crystals across the trampled earth.\n\n**No bodies.** But there's blood. A lot of it. A dark, dried smear trails from the cart west into the grass and disappears.\n\nYou notice three things:\n\n1. **Claw marks** gouged deep into the wagon's floor planks — four parallel grooves, each as wide as your finger. They look *exactly* like the symbol scratched into the waypost.\n\n2. A **torn leather satchel** caught under the wagon's axle. Something's still inside it.\n\n3. The smell. Faint but unmistakable — sour, animal, *wrong*. Like a wet dog mixed with rotting flowers.\n\nFrom the road, Drak whistles low. \"Tracks heading west. Big. Four-legged, heavy. Dragging something.\" A pause. \"...Two somethings.\"\n\nPip has gone very quiet, which is somehow worse than his chatter.\n\n---\n\n**The blood trail and tracks lead west into the grass.

It's just a satchel — torn loose in whatever violence happened here, pinned by the fallen axle. The buckle is smeared with dried blood.\n\nYou work it free and open it. Inside:\n\n1. **A crumpled letter**, partially blood-stained but legible. You unfold it:\n\n> *Harlen —*\n>\n> *Don't take the north road after dark. Three caravans lost this month. The garrison at Whisperhollow won't send patrols anymore. Captain Marda says it's wolves but she's lying. Wolves don't drag iron-banded crates into the hills. Wolves don't leave claw marks on stone.*\n>\n> *Take the long way around through Thornfield. I mean it.*\n>\n> *— Bessa*\n\n2. **A small coin purse** containing **12 silver pieces and 3 gold pieces**.\n\n3. **A stoppered clay vial** with a faded label reading *\"Tanner's — Antitoxin — 1 dose.\"*\n\nPip reads the letter over your shoulder. His jaw tightens. \"Harlen didn't take the long way around.\"\n\nDrak appears beside you — you didn't hear him move. He looks at the claw marks on the wagon floor, then at the letter. \n\n\"Not wolves.\" He touches one of the grooves with his copper-gloved hand, measuring the width. \"Too wide. Too deep. And wolves don't burst out of carts.\" His eyes track west, following the blood trail. \"Whatever this is, it's denning in the hills between here and Whisperhollow.\"\n\nEldon adjusts his spectacles, peering at the claw marks. \"The spacing suggests a creature roughly — carry the two — large dog-sized? No. Bigger. The force required to splinter oak planking like this is considerable. Some kind of monstrosity, maybe. Alchemical? Cursed? Oh, this is *terrible*.\" He sounds genuinely delighted.\n\nMirael stands upwind, her face pale. \"That smell. It's corruption. Something twisted from its natural shape.\" She looks at you. \"Whatever did this was in pain, Bramble. Pain makes predators unpredictable.\"\n\nVaelith eyes the blood trail heading west, then the road continuing north. \"So. We can follow the trail of the large, angry, cart-destroying thing into its lair...\" She gestures west. \"...or we can continue north to Whisperhollow, where apparently the guard captain is lying about what's happening on her roads.\" She gestures north. \"Terrible, or terrible. Dealer's choice, darling.\"\n\n---\n\n**You've found the letter, the coins (12 sp, 3 gp), the antitoxin, and the warning. The blood trail leads west toward the hills. The north road continues toward Whisperhollow, still a day and a half away.**\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**"

A bit of joy before the road! My gran always said, 'Dance while you've still got legs.' She was... also talking about the turnip blight, but the point stands!\"\n\nVaelith pinches the bridge of her nose. \"I'm traveling with a lunatic. Wonderful. This is fine.\"\n\nMirael watches you with the expression of someone observing a creature whose behavior does not appear in any known field guide.\n\nEldon claps absently, already reading Bessa's letter over your shoulder. \"Fascinating — the handwriting suggests education but rural dialect, possibly a trader's wife or guild clerk — oh, are we dancing? Is this a ritual?\"\n\n---\n\n## The Road North — Afternoon\n\nThe party moves on. The grasslands begin to change. The tall golden waves give way to shorter, tougher scrub. The ground rises in gentle swells. Scattered boulders appear — grey, lichen-covered, some bearing old chisel marks from a forgotten road or wall.\n\nThe wind picks up. The clouds thicken. By late afternoon, the first drops of cold rain begin to fall.\n\nDrak glances at the sky. \"Need shelter before dark. There.\" He points ahead and to the right — a rocky outcropping jutting from a hillside, forming a natural overhang. Big enough for the party. Defensible.\n\nAs you approach the shelter, Mirael suddenly stops. Her hand goes to her staff.\n\n\"We are not the first to use this place.\" She points to the ground beneath the overhang.\n\n**Old bones.** Animal bones — a deer, maybe two — cracked and splintered. Sucked clean of marrow. They're scattered around a shallow depression in the rock floor, like a nest.\n\nThe same sour, rotting-flower smell hangs faintly in the air.\n\nDrak crouches, touches a bone. \"...Cold. Old. Weeks, maybe.\" He scans the hills. \"Whatever used this moved on. But it could come back.\"\n\nThe rain is getting heavier.\n\n**You've found a defensible shelter for the night, but something has used it as a den before. The rain is coming down hard. The hills around you are dark and quiet.**\n\n**Camp here, or press on through the rain, Bramble?**"

The rain hammers down outside, turning the hillside into a cascade of small rivulets. You're dry, though. Mostly.\n\nPip produces a small iron pot from seemingly nowhere and gets to work. \"Right then! A bit of hard tack, those wild herbs from this morning, and — Drak, did you snare those rabbits earlier? Oh, you *did*. Brilliant. Tonight we feast! Well. We eat enthusiastically, at the very least.\"\n\nWithin the hour, the shelter smells like herb-roasted rabbit and wood smoke, which does a decent job of masking the lingering wrongness underneath.\n\nMirael pushes the old bones into a pile outside the overhang with her staff, murmuring something quiet — a small rite for the dead deer. She positions herself near the entrance, staff across her knees, watching the rain.\n\nEldon has already spread a collection of tiny gears and lenses across a flat rock and is tinkering by firelight, muttering calculations. Occasionally a small spark of arcane energy pops from his fingers and he says \"Ow\" without looking up.\n\nVaelith claims the driest corner, wraps herself in her cloak, and produces a slim leather journal. She writes in it with her back to the wall, angling the pages away from anyone who might glance over. \"Don't mind me, darlings. Just my memoirs. Chapter one: 'Poor Decisions and the People Who Make Them.'\"\n\n---\n\n## Night Watch\n\nDrak sets the rotation: himself first, then Mirael, then Bramble for the pre-dawn shift.\n\nThe night passes in shifts of rain and silence. During Drak's watch, nothing. Mirael's watch — she reports hearing something moving in the hills to the west. Large. Distant. Moving *away* from camp.\n\nThen it's your turn.\n\n**Bramble — Perception (night watch):** d20 + 2 (WIS +0, proficiency +2) = **8** *(rolled 6)*\n\nThe rain has stopped. A thick fog has crept in, blanketing everything beyond twenty feet in grey nothing. You sit by the dying fire, dagger across your knees, listening.\n\nYou don't hear much. An owl. Dripping water. Your own breathing.\n\nThen — just before dawn — a sound. Distant, muffled by the fog.\n\nA scream. Human. Cut short.\n\nIt came from the **north**. Toward Whisperhollow.\n\nThen silence again. Total, absolute silence. Even the owl has stopped.\n\nYou sit with that sound ringing in your ears until the grey light of dawn starts to burn through the fog. The others stir.\n\nDrak is up first. He reads your face. \"...What.\"\n\n---\n\nYou relieve yourself on the remains of the campfire. It sizzles and dies with a sad hiss. Pip wrinkles his nose but says nothing, which is a first.\n\nVaelith, emerging from her cloak: \"Charming. Truly. The bards will sing of this moment.\"\n\n---\n\nThe fog is lifting. The north road stretches ahead, climbing into the foothills. Whisperhollow is roughly a day's travel away.\n\n**You heard a scream in the night, Bramble. The party is packed and waiting.**\n\n**Do you tell them what you heard? And do you press on north?**"

Sound carries strange in these valleys.\" He checks his bowstring. \"We move fast. Stay sharp.\"\n\nMirael's knuckles are white on her staff. \"Whatever is hunting this road... it fed last night.\"\n\nVaelith pulls her cloak tight. For once, no quip. Then — almost to herself — \"Well. At least we know it's real.\"\n\nEldon swallows hard but squares his tiny shoulders. \"Right. Yes. North. Into danger. Toward the screaming. This is — this is what adventurers do, yes? Perfectly normal. I'm fine. Everyone's fine.\"\n\n---\n\n## Day 2 — The Northern Foothills\n\nThe road climbs. The grasslands are behind you now, replaced by rocky hillsides dotted with gnarled, wind-bent trees. The fog burns off by mid-morning, revealing a grey sky and a landscape of dark stone and brown bracken.\n\nDrak keeps stopping to read the ground.\n\n**Drak — Survival (tracking):** d20 + 3 = **21** *(rolled 18)*\n\n\"Tracks,\" he says, crouching by the roadside. He points. Deep gouges in the mud — four-clawed, wide-spaced. The same prints from the cart. \"Fresh. Hours old. Heading north.\" A long pause. \"Same direction we're going.\"\n\nHe points to something else. Boot prints. Two sets. Running. One set stops abruptly. The mud is churned and dark.\n\n\"One got away,\" he says. \"One didn't.\"\n\nNo body. Just drag marks leading off the road into a narrow ravine choked with dead brush.\n\nThe party presses on. The hills close in around the road. By late afternoon, the wind shifts and carries a new smell — woodsmoke. Real woodsmoke. Chimney smoke.\n\nThen, cresting a ridge, you see it.\n\n---\n\n## Whisperhollow\n\nA village wedged into a narrow valley between two steep, forested hills. Maybe forty buildings — stone foundations, timber walls, thatch roofs. A shallow river cuts through the middle, spanned by an old stone bridge. Farmland on the south slope, terraced and brown. A squat stone tower on the north end — the garrison.\n\nSmoke rises from a dozen chimneys. It should look welcoming.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nThe gates are shut. A wooden palisade — recently built, raw timber, still oozing sap — rings the village. Sharpened stakes angle outward from the base. Watch fires burn on platforms at the corners, even though it's still daylight.\n\nTwo figures stand on the gate platform with crossbows. They've already spotted you.\n\nOne of them calls down, voice tight with suspicion:\n\n**\"That's far enough! State your names and your business, or turn around and walk south!\"**\n\nDrak's hand drifts to his bow. Mirael touches his arm. He stops.\n\nVaelith leans toward you and murmurs, \"Your show, darling. You've got the face for diplomacy. I've got the face for... well, starting problems.\"\n\nPip steps up beside you, voice low: \"Easy does it, Bramble. These folks are scared. Scared people do foolish things.\"\n\n---\n\n**You're at the gates of Whisperhollow. The guards are tense. Crossbows are loaded.**\n\n**What do you say, Bramble?**"

A grim man in a copper glove with a hawk on his shoulder. A gnome buried under a clanking backpack. Another halfling waving cheerfully. A serene elf. A tiefling examining her nails.\n\n**\"...Fairy folk.\"**\n\nThe other guard — younger, nervous, white-knuckle grip on his crossbow — hisses, \"Marda said not to let anyone in, Bren.\"\n\nThe woman — Bren — ignores him.

The hardness cracks, just for a second. She grips the palisade rail.\n\nThe younger guard whispers, \"Bren, that's — that's Bessa's husband —\"\n\n**\"Shut it, Tomm.\"** Bren straightens. She stares down at the party for a long moment. Then:\n\n**\"You heard something on the road. The screaming. Last night.\"**\n\nIt's not a question.\n\n**\"Gate opens in thirty seconds. Get inside fast. And if Captain Marda asks — I let you in because you had trade goods.\"** She turns to Tomm. **\"Open it.\"**\n\nThe heavy timber gate groans inward. Beyond it: a muddy main street, shuttered windows, and the smell of fear dressed up as woodsmoke.\n\nA village holding its breath.\n\n---\n\n**You're inside Whisperhollow. The gate slams shut behind you. Bren is climbing down from the platform. She looks like she wants to talk — but she's watching the garrison tower nervously.**\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**"

But not of the thing in the hills. She's scared of something *else.*\"\n\nVaelith's eyes narrow. \"How interesting. A guard captain more afraid of the cure than the disease. That usually means she's hiding something, darling.\"\n\nMirael speaks quietly. \"The creature in the hills — you've seen it?\"\n\nBren shakes her head. \"No one has. Not clearly. Tormund — he's a shepherd, drinks too much — says he saw something on the ridge three nights ago. Big. Moved on all fours, then stood up on two legs.\" Her voice drops. \"He said it *looked at him*. Like it was deciding something. Then it walked away.\"\n\nEldon is practically vibrating. \"Quadrupedal-to-bipedal transition — that rules out most natural fauna — could be a lycanthropic variant, or a transmuted creature, or possibly a —\"\n\n\"*Eldon,*\" Vaelith cuts in. \"Read the room.\"\n\nBren looks at your group — really looks. Six armed travelers who walked the north road and lived. Something shifts in her expression. Hope, maybe. Desperate, fragile hope.\n\n\"The tavern's called the Penny Whistle. Innkeeper's name is Dorma — she'll put you up. Tormund drinks there every night. And if you want answers about Marda...\" She leans in. \"There's a woman named **Bessa** — yes, *that* Bessa. She lives on the south end. She's been asking questions the captain doesn't want asked.\"\n\nShe straightens up and steps back, all business again. \"I never talked to you. You had trade goods. That's all.\"\n\nAnd she's gone, climbing back up to her post.\n\n---\n\nThe village of Whisperhollow stretches before you — quiet, frightened, full of secrets. The rain has stopped but water drips from every eave. \n\n**You have several threads to pull:**\n- 🍺 **The Penny Whistle tavern** — rooms, food, and Tormund the shepherd who saw the creature\n- 🏠 **Bessa's house** — the woman whose husband Harlen is now almost certainly dead, and who's been asking dangerous questions  \n- 🗼 **The garrison tower** — Captain Marda, who's hiding something\n- 🏔️ **The north hills** — where the creature lairs\n\n**It's late afternoon.

Promise.\" Eldon is already walking the wrong direction. Pip steers him south by the elbow.\n\nVaelith falls into step beside you, a razor smile on her lips. \"You and me at the tavern. Darling, this is the first sensible decision you've made all day.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Penny Whistle — Late Afternoon\n\nThe tavern is a low, sagging building with a faded sign — a tin whistle painted copper. Inside: dark beams, a smoky hearth, and the desperate cheer of a place trying very hard to feel normal.\n\nSix locals sit scattered across the room. They look up when you enter. A tiefling and a halfling walking into a bar — in a village this small, this frightened, you might as well have fired a cannon.\n\nThe innkeeper, **Dorma**, is a stout human woman with kind eyes and flour-dusted hands. She's already pouring before you reach the bar.\n\n\"Travelers. Haven't had those in a while.\" She sets down two mugs of something dark and foamy. \"First round's on the house. You look like you need it.\"\n\nAnd in the corner — that must be **Tormund**.\n\nHe's a wreck. A big man gone soft, hunched over a table with three empty tankards and a fourth he's working on. Ruddy face, burst capillaries, hands that won't stop shaking. His shepherd's crook leans against the wall behind him.\n\nHe's muttering to himself. The other locals give his table a wide berth.\n\nYou take your ale. Vaelith takes hers, sniffs it, raises an eyebrow, and drinks anyway.\n\n\"The shaking one in the corner, I presume?\" she murmurs. \"Shall I charm him, or do you want to do this the old-fashioned way? I should warn you — my old-fashioned way also involves charm. And lying.\"\n\n---\n\n**You're in the Penny Whistle. Tormund is right there, deep in his cups. Dorma seems friendly.

He blinks at you three times, as if trying to determine whether you're real or a hallucination brought on by bad ale.\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nVaelith slides into the chair beside you, all silk and shadow. She sets a **fresh tankard** in front of Tormund — purchased from Dorma with a wink and a silver coin. \"What my *eloquent* friend means is — we're not from here, we're not afraid of whatever's out there, and we hear you're the only one who's actually seen it.\" She pushes the tankard closer. \"We'd love to hear your story, Tormund. The *real* one. Not the wolf nonsense.\"\n\nThe fresh ale does what your words didn't.

I was bringing the flock down off the north ridge. Late — my fault, I know — and the moon was up.\"\n\nHis hands tighten on the tankard.\n\n\"I saw it on the ridgeline. Maybe sixty yards out. At first I thought it was a bear. Big. Dark. Down on all fours. But then it...\" He swallows. \"It *stood up*. Like a man. But wrong. Too tall. Too thin. The joints were — the joints bent the wrong way. Backwards, like. And the *head*.\"\n\nHe taps the side of his skull.\n\n\"No ears. No proper face. Just a mouth. Wide. Too wide.

The other locals are pretending not to listen. They're all listening.\n\n\"It looked at me. Right at me. And I swear on my mother's grave — it *smiled*. Then it dropped back to all fours and just... loped off into the trees. Didn't make a sound. Something that big should make a sound.\"\n\nHe drains the rest of the tankard in one go.\n\n\"I told Marda. She said I was drunk. I *was* drunk. But I wasn't *that* drunk.\" He looks at you, and underneath the alcohol and the terror, there's something fierce. \"That thing's got a den up in the hills somewhere. The old **Hallen Mine** — it's been closed twenty years, but that's where the tracks lead. Everyone knows it. Marda knows it. She won't go near it, and she won't say why.\"\n\nHe grabs your sleeve.\n\n\"You want to fix this? The mine. That's where it sleeps.\"\n\n---\n\nVaelith catches your eye across the table. One eyebrow raised. *The mine.*\n\n**You've got a lead — the old Hallen Mine in the northern hills. And a deeper question: why won't Captain Marda act?**\n\n**The others haven't returned yet.

The Hallen Mine didn't just close because the silver ran out. Old Gerrik — the one whose family vanished — he was the last foreman. He sealed it himself. Said they'd dug into something. A *chamber*. Not natural. Carved. He wouldn't say more.\"\n\nA second finger. \"Two. Captain Marda goes up to the hills alone. At night.

The attacks started exactly two months ago. You know what happened two months ago?\" He jabs the finger at the table. \"A group of scholars came through. Four of 'em. From some university down south. Said they were researching old mines. Marda gave them a guide. They went up to Hallen.\" He pauses. \"They never came back. The guide neither. And *that's* when the killing started.\"\n\nHe sits back, spent. The tankard trembles in his grip.\n\n\"Marda told everyone the scholars moved on. Took the east road. But I saw their mules still in the garrison stable a week later.\" He fixes you with bloodshot, desperate eyes. \"Nobody comes back from that mine.

I packed their provisions myself. Enough for two days.\" She moves on, wiping tables. \"They had a journal. Leather-bound. Gold clasp. The one in charge — a woman, white hair, spectacles — she never let it out of her sight.\"\n\nThen she's gone, back behind the bar.\n\n---\n\nThe tavern door bangs open.\n\nPip and Eldon bustle in, shaking rain from their cloaks. Pip's face is drawn — serious Pip, the one that comes out when things are truly bad.\n\nAnd right behind them — Drak and Mirael. Drak's expression is carved granite. Mirael looks troubled in a way you haven't seen before.\n\nThey converge on your table. Pip pulls up chairs.

Said we should move on in the morning.\"\n\nMirael picks up, her voice measured: \"I watched her carefully. She is not corrupt. She is *terrified*. There is a difference. When Drak mentioned the Hallen Mine, she flinched as if struck. She said it was condemned and forbidden to enter.

And I would know.\"\n\nMirael's eyes flick to Vaelith — sharp, uncomfortable — then away.\n\nDrak lays his copper-gloved hand flat on the table. \"Doesn't matter what she promised. People are dying. The mine is the source.\" He looks at you. \"We go up there. We end this.\"\n\nPip nods slowly. \"But not tonight. We'd be walking into its hunting ground in the dark. That's its territory, its rules.\" He looks at you. \"Dawn, Bramble. We go at first light.\"\n\nEldon is scribbling furiously in a notebook. \"I'll need to research wards — pre-Sundering containment glyphs — if the scholars broke a seal, there may be a way to restore it, or at least identify what was bound —\"\n\n\"Or we kill it,\" Drak says.\n\n\"...Or we kill it, yes, that's also an option —\"\n\n---\n\n**The party is aligned.

He's cross-referencing pre-Sundering ward symbols with his own notes on containment magic.\n\n\"Sealing glyphs, binding circles, planar anchors — if the scholars broke a ward, there should be residual thaumic signatures — I'll need chalk, silver dust if anyone has it, and ideally a — does anyone have a prism?

Pip does most of the charm work — buying rounds, telling stories, drawing people out.\n\n**Pip — Persuasion:** d20 + 2 = **16** *(rolled 14)*\n\nOver the course of two hours, you piece together a picture:\n\nAn old farmer named **Coll** draws you a rough map on the back of a napkin with charcoal:\n\n> **The Hallen Mine:**\n> - Two-hour climb north of the village, up a switchback trail\n> - Main entrance — a timber-framed adit cut into a cliff face. Was boarded up by old Gerrik twenty years ago\n> - Two levels: an **upper gallery** (the worked silver veins) and a **lower chamber** (what the miners broke into — the one Gerrik sealed)\n> - A vertical shaft connects the two levels — rope and bucket hoist, probably rotted by now\n> - One known **ventilation shaft** on the hillside above — narrow, but a halfling might fit\n> - The river that runs through Whisperhollow originates from a spring inside the mine's upper level\n\nColl sets down his charcoal and looks at you. \"My da worked that mine. Said when they broke through to the lower chamber, the air that came up smelled like *flowers*. Sweet. Wrong. Three men got nosebleeds and one fainted.\" He shakes his head. \"Gerrik sealed it the next day. Poured rubble into the shaft. Said some doors are closed for a reason.\"\n\nVaelith taps the napkin map. \"Ventilation shaft. Main entrance. Two ways in. I like options.\"\n\nMirael studies the sketch. \"The spring water — has it changed? Taste, color, smell?\"\n\nColl hesitates. \"...Now you mention it. Last few weeks. Slightly sweet. The goats won't drink it anymore.\"\n\nMirael and Vaelith exchange a look.\n\n---\n\n### Drak — Surveillance\n\nLate. Near midnight. The tavern has emptied. You're nursing a last ale when the back door opens silently and Drak is just *there*, like he materialized.\n\n**Drak — Stealth:** d20 + 3 = **22** *(rolled 19)*\n\nHe sits. Says nothing for ten seconds. Then:\n\n\"She went.\"\n\nHe lays it out in fragments. Classic Drak.\n\n\"North gate. Midnight. Alone. No torch. She knows the path. Followed her half a mile up the switchback toward the mine.\" Pause. \"She stopped at a flat rock. Left something. A bundle — cloth, wrapped around something heavy. Meat, maybe. And a...\" He frowns. \"A letter. She weighed it down with a stone. Then she sat on the ground.\"\n\nLong pause.\n\n\"She *talked*. To nothing. To the dark. Couldn't hear the words. But her voice...\" Another pause. \"She was begging.\"\n\nHe looks at the table.\n\n\"Then she walked back. I checked the rock after she left. The bundle was gone. Something had taken it. No tracks. No sound.\" His copper-gloved hand flexes. \"I don't like this, Bramble. She's feeding it. Bargaining with it. And it's not working — people are still dying.\"\n\n---\n\nThe fire pops in the hearth. The Penny Whistle is empty except for your party. Dorma has left a key on the bar and gone to bed. Rain taps against the shutters.\n\nPip breaks the silence, voice quiet and steady — serious Pip. \"So we've got a creature in a mine. Something old, something that was sealed away. The scholars let it out. Marda's trying to keep it appeased. And it's getting hungrier.\" He looks around the table. \"Dawn, then. We go up, we find it, and we either put it back or put it down.\"\n\nVaelith raises her mug. \"To terrible decisions made in poorly lit taverns.\"\n\nEveryone drinks.\n\n---\n\n**The party settles in for a long rest at the Penny Whistle.

His eyes are wild with caffeine and discovery.\n\n\"Ah! Good! Everyone's up!\" He waves a sheaf of notes. \"Right, so — pre-Sundering containment wards. Fascinating stuff.

Loose shale, stunted trees, cold wind. The village shrinks below you. The hills close in.\n\nDrak leads. He finds Marda's tracks from last night — and the flat rock where she left her offering.

That smell again — sour flowers, stronger now.\n\nTwo hours of climbing.\n\nThen the trail ends at a cliff face, and there it is.\n\n---\n\n## The Hallen Mine\n\nA black mouth in grey rock. The timber frame is ancient, half-rotted, leaning drunkenly. The boards that once sealed it have been **ripped away from the inside** — splintered outward, nails bent. Beyond the entrance: darkness. Total, absolute darkness.\n\nAnd the smell. Not faint anymore. It rolls out of the mine in a slow, sweet, nauseating wave. Like a field of flowers rotting in stagnant water.\n\nCold air breathes out of the tunnel. Unnaturally cold.\n\nDrak nocks an arrow. Mirael's grip tightens on her staff. Pip drops into a low, balanced stance — combat Pip. Eldon clutches his chalk and silver. Vaelith's hands glow faintly green.\n\nFrom somewhere deep inside the mine, echoing up through stone and darkness, you hear something.\n\nBreathing.\n\nSlow.

You march straight toward the gaping maw of the Hallen Mine like a halfling-shaped carnival.\n\nPip — *immediately* — falls in behind you, matching your rhythm. \"WOCKA WOCKA!\" He can't help himself. It's in his blood.\n\nVaelith: \"I want to die. Not in the mine. Right here. Right now.\"\n\nDrak closes his eyes for a very long time. Opens them. Nocks an arrow. Follows.\n\nMirael grips her staff and walks after you, mouth set in a thin line. \"...The oak does not question the wind,\" she murmurs to herself. \"It simply endures.\"\n\nEldon trots along, clanking. \"Is this a tactical distraction? It's a tactical distraction, isn't it? Brilliant! The creature won't expect — well, *nobody* would expect —\"\n\n---\n\n## The Hallen Mine — Upper Gallery\n\nYour wocka-wockas echo into the darkness and come back *wrong* — stretched, distorted, like the mine is chewing on the sound.\n\nTorchlight pushes back the black. The tunnel is about eight feet wide, shored up with rotting timbers. Water drips from the ceiling. Old cart rails run along the floor, rusted to brown lace.\n\nThe sour-flower smell is thick now. Cloying. It coats the back of your throat.\n\nThirty feet in, the tunnel opens into a wider chamber — the **upper gallery**. Old mining equipment lies scattered: picks, a collapsed sluice, ore buckets. Three tunnels branch off — left, right, and center. The center tunnel slopes **downward**.\n\nAnd your wocka-wockas have done something.\n\nThe breathing has stopped.\n\nThe silence that follows is *worse*. It's the silence of something that was sleeping and is now **awake** and **listening**.\n\nFrom deep below — down the center tunnel — a sound. Not breathing this time.\n\nA low, wet clicking. Like a jaw working. Testing. Tasting the air.\n\nThen, echoing up from the depths, distorted and *wrong*:\n\n**\"...wocka...\"**\n\nIt repeated you.\n\nEvery hair on your body stands up. Pip's dance stops mid-step. His face goes blank — combat Pip, instant, like a switch.\n\nDrak draws his bow to full. \"It learns,\" he whispers.\n\nEldon's voice is very small. \"That's — that's a mimicry response — highly intelligent predator behavior — oh dear. Oh *dear*.\"\n\nMirael's staff begins to glow faintly with druidic light. She looks at you, eyes steady.\n\nVaelith's hands crackle with green energy — flickering, unsteady, but *there*. \"Well, darling. You got its attention. Congratulations.\"\n\n---\n\n**You're in the upper gallery. Three tunnels: left, right, and center (descending). The creature is below and now very much awake. Eldon mentioned the ward-stones — they'd be arranged in a triangle around the lower chamber.**\n\n**The clicking sound continues from below. Patient. Waiting.**\n\n**What's the move, Bramble?**"
