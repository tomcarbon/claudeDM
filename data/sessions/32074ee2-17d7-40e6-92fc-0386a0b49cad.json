Let me set the scene.\n\n---\n\n# 🎭 The Festival of Masks\n### *Behind Every Mask, Another Face; Behind Every Face, A Lie*\n\n---\n\nThe air hits you before the city does — brine and roasted garlic and something sweet, like crushed flowers ground into wine. **Saltmere, the City of Tides**, sprawls down its limestone terraces toward a harbor glittering with a thousand lantern-lit gondolas, and tonight, it is *alive*.\n\nColored silks drape between buildings like the rigging of some enormous dream-ship. Paper lanterns bob on strings above the canals, painting the water in shifting reds and golds. Every square, every alley, every rooftop terrace pulses with music — pipe and drum and fiddle layered over each other until the whole city hums like a plucked string.\n\nAnd the **masks**. Gods, the masks. Everywhere you look: painted porcelain faces, feathered half-visors, grotesque wooden things with leering grins, delicate lacework veils, all hiding the faces of revelers who have become — for three glorious nights — someone else entirely.\n\nYou, **Bramble Thornfoot**, are in your element. A city full of hidden faces, loose purse strings, and people too drunk on festival wine to notice nimble fingers? It's enough to make a halfling weep with joy.\n\n---\n\nYour companions move through the crowd around you on the **Grand Promenade**, each taking to the festival in their own way.\n\n**Drak** walks a step behind the group, one hand resting near his belt knife, eyes scanning the rooftops and side-alleys with the restless vigilance of a man who has never quite learned to stop looking for threats. His hawk, **Talon**, circles overhead, a dark silhouette against the firework-bright sky. He wears no mask. When Pip tried to hand him one earlier, he just looked at it, then at Pip, then walked away.\n\n**Eldon** has stopped for the third time in ten minutes, this time to examine the hinge mechanism on a mask-vendor's display case. \"Pre-Sundering brass fittings — *remarkable*. Do you see the counter-tension spring? This is Keldori craftsmanship, or I'll eat my hat. Not that I'm wearing a — oh, are those candied almonds? Anyway, the spring coefficient alone suggests —\"\n\n**Pip** is already three stalls ahead, chatting with a food vendor, tasting something on a wooden skewer, and laughing like he's known the man for years. He turns back and calls out, \"Friends! You *must* try these — little squid things, fried up with chili and lime. As my gran always said, you can't solve the world's problems on an empty stomach!\"\n\n**Sister Mirael** walks at the group's edge, near the canal railing, where the crowd thins and she can breathe. The festival noise makes her tense — her fingers worry at the wooden holy symbol around her neck. But occasionally a potted fern or climbing vine catches her eye, and her expression softens.\n\n**Vaelith** strides through the crowd like she owns the Promenade and is merely tolerating everyone else's presence on it. Her mask — a dramatic black-and-silver half-face — was the most expensive one at the stall, naturally. \"I must say, darling,\" she drawls, glancing at Bramble, \"a city where *everyone* hides their true face? I've never felt more at home.\"\n\n---\n\nThen the **screams** start.\n\nSharp. Close. Cutting through the music like a knife through silk.\n\nThe crowd ahead of you convulses — people shoving backward, festival masks knocked askew, drinks spilling, a child crying. A woman stumbles out of a narrow alley between a spice merchant's stall and a silk draper's shop, her painted mask cracked, her hands shaking.\n\n\"**Dead!**\" she gasps. \"There's — someone's *dead* in there!\"\n\nDrak's hand is on his knife. Talon drops lower, circling the alley. Pip's smile vanishes like a candle snuffed.\n\nMirael says, very quietly, \"...The river has turned.\"\n\nVaelith adjusts her mask. \"Well. That's one way to liven up a party.\"\n\n---\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?** The alley is right there, the crowd parting around it like water around a stone. You can hear boots — city watch, probably — coming up the Promenade behind you, but they're still a minute out. Whatever's in that alley, you'd see it first."

The woman with the cracked mask is sobbing into a stranger's shoulder. The crowd is pulling back, but you and your companions stand at the alley's mouth.\n\nPip murmurs, low and serious: \"Someone needs to go in there.\"\n\nDrak grunts. Already moving.\n\n**路地に入りますか、ブランブル？** *(Roji ni hairimasu ka, Buranbury?)* \n**Do you enter the alley, Bramble?** 🎲"

      "text": "\n\nBramble squares his shoulders — such as they are — and slips into the alley like a shadow peeling off the wall.\n\n---\n\nThe festival's music seems distant and wrong as you push through the gathering crowd into a narrow alley between a spice merchant's stall and a silk draper's shop. A figure lies face-down on the cobblestones, dressed in rich blue velvet, a festival mask of painted porcelain still covering the upper half of their face. A jeweled dagger protrudes from between the shoulder blades, and a pool of dark liquid — blood, you realize — spreads slowly across the ancient stone.\n\nDrak is beside you in a heartbeat, crouching, eyes moving from the body to the rooftops to the alley's dead end and back. \"...Fresh,\" he mutters. Talon lands on a windowsill above, head cocked.\n\nEldon peers around Bramble's shoulder. \"Oh. Oh *dear*. That's — yes, that's quite a lot of blood. The viscosity is interesting, actually, the way it's pooling suggests —\"\n\n\"Not now, Eldon,\" Pip says quietly. The halfling monk's face is still, his usual warmth banked like coals. He positions himself at the alley's mouth, watching the crowd.\n\nMirael kneels near the body without touching it, her expression unreadable. \"...The soil remembers what walks upon it,\" she murmurs. \"This ground has a story to tell.\"\n\nVaelith hangs back, arms crossed, her silver-and-black mask catching the lantern light. \"Blue velvet. Custom tailoring. Whoever this was, darling, they were *somebody*.\"\n\nThen — boots on cobblestone. A woman in city watch armor shoves through the crowd, tall, athletic, a scar running from her left ear to her jaw. She takes one look at the scene and swears under her breath.\n\n\"That's **Aldric Voss's** clothing,\" she mutters. \"The wealthiest merchant in Saltmere, dead on the biggest night of the year. This is going to be a *nightmare*.\"\n\nShe turns to you — all of you — with sharp, appraising eyes.\n\n\"**Captain Reva Ashford**, city watch. I've got two hundred guards trying to keep ten thousand drunk, masked idiots from burning the city down tonight, and now I've got a dead merchant in an alley.\" She pulls a folded parchment from her belt and presses it into Bramble's hand. \"You lot look capable, and more importantly, you're *outsiders*. No ties to local politics. No debts to the guilds.\"\n\nShe fixes Bramble with a look that says *don't make me regret this.*\n\n\"I'm deputizing you. **This writ gives you authority to question citizens and enter Voss's properties.** Find out who did this before the trail goes cold. Report to me at the watch house on Silver Street.\"\n\nShe glances at the body once more, jaw tight, and disappears back into the crowd.\n\n---\n\n**Bramble** — you're standing over a dead man in a dark alley with a jeweled dagger in his back and a city full of masked strangers. \n\nYou've got a few obvious moves here:\n\n🔍 **死体を調べる** *(Shitai wo shiraberu)* — Examine the body closely (Medicine, Investigation, or Perception checks)\n\n🗣️ **目撃者を探す** *(Mokugekisha wo sagasu)* — Look for witnesses in the crowd\n\n🏛️ **情報を集める** *(Jōhō wo atsumeru)* — Ask your companions what they notice\n\nThe body isn't going anywhere. But in a city of masks, the killer could already be three streets away wearing a new face.\n\n**どうする？** *(Dō suru?)* What do you do? 🎲"
