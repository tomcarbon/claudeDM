Let me set the scene.\n\n---\n\n# The Lost Mine of Whisperhollow\n### *What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. Whisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall, then scattered cottages with dark windows, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called the **Pickaxe & Pint**, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. From somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.\n\n---\n\nThe late afternoon light slants golden through the valley, but there's a wrongness to the silence here. No dogs barking. No children playing. Just shuttered windows and the distant bleating of sheep that sound more anxious than they should.\n\nBramble, your eyes do what they always do in a new place — cataloguing exits, valuables, and threats. Behind you, the rest of the company files in along the muddy track.\n\nDrak halts at the edge of the village, nostrils flaring. He crouches, touches the road. \"...Ground's trembling,\" he says flatly. \"Not natural.\"\n\nEldon nearly walks into Drak's back, nose buried in a battered notebook. \"Fascinating — do you feel that resonance? Sub-harmonic, if I'm not mistaken. Consistent frequency, which suggests a — oh, what a charming well! Pre-Sundering stonework, clearly. But yes, the vibrations. Deeply unusual for non-volcanic geography.\"\n\nPip Whistledown falls into step beside you, his perpetual grin not quite hiding the way his eyes sweep the empty street. \"Cozy little place, isn't it, friend? Reminds me of Bramblewood, 'cept for the whole... eerie-abandoned-ghost-village feel.\" He sniffs the air. \"Somebody's got a stew on, though. That's a good sign. Can't be all bad where there's stew.\"\n\nSister Mirael pauses at the village boundary, one hand resting on a gnarled walking staff. Her eyes close for a moment. \"...The land is uneasy,\" she murmurs. \"Like a sleeper caught in a dream it cannot wake from.\"\n\nAnd Vaelith brings up the rear, arms crossed, surveying Whisperhollow with theatrical disdain. \"Charming. Truly. When the letter said 'village,' I was hoping for at least one building with all its windows intact.\" She adjusts her collar. \"Well, darlings, shall we find whoever's desperate enough to have summoned *us*?\"\n\nThe tavern door is the only one not barred shut. Warm light spills from the cracks, and the murmur of nervous voices carries into the dusk.\n\n---\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?** The Pickaxe & Pint awaits, and with it, presumably, the village elder Brenna Stonemantle and whatever grim news prompted her letter. But you've also got that well with its interesting carvings, the dark hillside above the village where the mine entrance should be, and a whole village of shuttered homes that a halfling with your particular skill set could investigate quite thoroughly...\n\nThe choice is yours."

      "text": "Bramble's fingers find the clasp of his cloak, and for one fleeting moment, the thought crosses his mind—\n\nThen Pip's hand lands gently on his shoulder.\n\n\"Now, friend,\" Pip says, his voice warm but his grip surprisingly firm for a halfling monk, \"I know we've been on the road a while, and maybe the mountain air's got you feeling *free-spirited*, but as my gran always said: you don't shuck the corn before you're in the kitchen.\"\n\nDrak glances over. One eyebrow rises a fraction of an inch. \"...No.\"\n\nVaelith tilts her head, a slow grin spreading across her face. \"Oh, *do* go ahead, darling. I could use the entertainment. But I should warn you — I've seen what the mountain cold does to halflings, and it's not the *confident entrance* you're imagining.\"\n\nEldon doesn't even look up from his notebook. \"Hypothermia sets in remarkably fast at this altitude. Core temperature drops, vasoconstriction in the extremities, cognitive impairment — actually, that last one might explain the impulse.\"\n\nMirael simply fixes you with a long, still look. The kind your mother would have given you, if your mother had been a centuries-old elf druid who could turn into a bear.\n\n\"...The river does not bare its stones to prove its strength,\" she says quietly.\n\n---\n\n**The moment passes.** You keep your clothes on, because you are a professional, and professionals enter strange taverns in declining villages *fully dressed and armed.*\n\nThe Pickaxe & Pint's door groans open. Inside, a dozen weathered faces turn toward you — farmers, shepherds, a few old miners nursing ales with white-knuckled grips. The tavern smells of woodsmoke, mutton stew, and quiet desperation. Behind the bar hangs a faded map of tunnels, yellowed with age.\n\nA stout, silver-haired dwarven woman rises from a corner table, a well-worn holy symbol of Moradin clutched in her fingers. Her eyes — tired, hopeful, afraid — find yours.\n\n\"You came,\" Brenna Stonemantle says, her voice rough with relief. \"Gods be praised. You actually came.\"\n\nAt the bar, a grizzled old man with a wild gray beard slams his tankard down. **\"Fools is what they are,\"** Old Tormund growls. **\"Walking into a curse with their eyes open. Mark my words — that mine's swallowed better folk than these.\"**\n\nA young woman with sun-browned skin and sharp hazel eyes shoots Tormund a venomous look from across the room. **\"Shut it, Tormund.\"** Elara Windmere turns to you, and beneath her hard expression you can see it — the raw, desperate fear of someone whose family is in danger. \"My brother's in that mine. He's been in there *two weeks*. Are you going to help us or not?\"\n\nThe whole tavern holds its breath, waiting on you.\n\n---\n\n**What do you say, Bramble?**"
