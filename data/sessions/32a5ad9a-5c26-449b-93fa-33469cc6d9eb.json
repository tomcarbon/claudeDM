      "text": "Now I have everything I need. Let me begin the adventure.\n\n---\n\n# The Lost Mine of Whisperhollow\n### *What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe letter arrived three days ago at the trading post in Cragside, pressed into your hand by a wild-eyed shepherd boy who'd ridden two days without stopping. The parchment was creased, smudged with soot, and written in a hand that trembled:\n\n> *\"To any brave souls willing to help — the ground shakes. The mine screams. Three of our people went to look and have not come back. We have little coin but we have need. Please. Whisperhollow is dying.\"*\n>\n> *— Brenna Stonemantle, Elder of Whisperhollow*\n\nThat letter is how you found yourself on this road, Bramble — climbing a narrow mountain track with four strangers-turned-companions at your back and a cold wind biting at your ears.\n\n---\n\n**The road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. Whisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall, then scattered cottages with dark windows, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called the Pickaxe & Pint, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. From somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.**\n\nEvening is settling over the valley like a bruise. Thin smoke curls from the tavern's chimney, and through its fogged windows you can see the warm flicker of firelight and the shapes of people hunched over their drinks.\n\nBehind you, Drak has stopped walking. His hawk, Talon, shifts uneasily on his shoulder. The ranger's eyes scan the tree line, then the dark hillside above the village where — just barely visible — a massive set of iron doors are set into the mountainside.\n\n\"...Quiet,\" he grunts. \"Wrong kind of quiet.\"\n\nEldon nearly walks into you, nose buried in a battered notebook. \"Fascinating — do you *feel* that resonance? Sub-harmonic, almost certainly geological in origin, though the periodicity suggests — oh.\" He looks up, blinks at the village. \"We're here. Right. Yes. Quaint. Very... structurally concerning.\"\n\nPip adjusts his pack and takes a deep breath of mountain air, his perpetual grin firmly in place. \"Well now, that tavern looks like it could use some cheering up, and I could use a warm bowl of something. As my gran always said, you can't solve a mystery on an empty stomach — unless the mystery *is* what's in the stew, and even then, best to eat first and ask questions later.\"\n\nSister Mirael says nothing. She stands perfectly still, one hand pressed flat against a nearby tree trunk, her eyes half-closed. After a long moment: \"...The earth grieves here. Something below is wounded.\" She opens her eyes. \"We should speak with the elder.\"\n\nVaelith strolls past everyone, pulling her cloak tighter against the chill with practiced elegance. \"Charming. A dying village, a cursed mine, and I assume zero decent wine within forty miles.\" She glances back over her shoulder with a razor smile. \"Well, darlings? Shall we go introduce ourselves to the locals, or would you prefer to stand in the road looking dramatic until something eats us?\"\n\nThe tavern door is twenty paces ahead. The village square is empty. And beneath your feet, the mountain hums.\n\n---\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**\n\nYou can head into the **Pickaxe & Pint** to gather information, seek out **Brenna Stonemantle** directly, scout the village for anything interesting, or anything else your criminal instincts suggest. The night is young — but those vibrations aren't getting any quieter."
