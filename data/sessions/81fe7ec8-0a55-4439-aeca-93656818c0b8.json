Let me set the scene.\n\n---\n\n# The Lost Mine of Whisperhollow\n### *What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. Evening has draped the peaks in bruised violet, and a cold wind funnels down through the gap, carrying with it the smell of wet stone and sheep dung and something else — something mineral and deep, like licking a copper coin.\n\nWhisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall, then scattered cottages with dark windows, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called **the Pickaxe & Pint**, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. From somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.\n\nYou arrived together — a mismatched company drawn by the same desperate letter, passed hand to hand along the trade roads until it found each of you in turn. Brenna Stonemantle's words were plain and pleading: *Come. We have no one else.*\n\n---\n\nBramble, you noticed the letter pinned to a job board in a trading post three days east of here, tucked between a bounty for wolf pelts and a missing person notice. The pay was pitiful — a village's meager savings — but the letter mentioned a *sealed mine*, and sealed things have a way of being worth opening, don't they? Your fingers hadn't stopped itching since.\n\nBeside you, **Drak** walks with his longbow slung across his back and his hawk, **Talon**, circling lazily overhead despite the fading light. His copper-gloved hand rests on his belt near his shortswords. He hasn't spoken in nearly an hour. He pauses now, tilting his head, nostrils flaring.\n\n\"...Livestock. Penned too close to the houses. Scared of something.\" A long pause. \"Smart animals.\"\n\n**Eldon** nearly bumps into Drak's back, nose buried in a brass instrument that might be a compass or might be a cheese grater. \"Hmm? Oh — yes, we've arrived, excellent. Did anyone else notice the subsonic oscillation approximately two hundred meters back? Consistent frequency, roughly four-point-seven hertz, which is *fascinating* because that corresponds almost precisely to the resonance frequency of — oh, is that a *well?* Pre-Sundering stonework if I'm not mistaken, look at the mortar composition—\"\n\n**Pip** claps a hand on Eldon's shoulder, grinning wide. \"Easy there, friend — let's find the hearth before we find the mortar, eh? As my gran always said, you can't study on an empty stomach, and you can't solve problems on cold feet.\" He adjusts the simple pack on his back and takes a deep, appreciative breath of the mountain air. \"Smells like home. Well — home with a touch of something unsettling underneath, but home all the same.\"\n\n**Sister Mirael** says nothing. She stands at the village's edge, one slender hand resting on a gnarled wooden staff, her elven eyes distant as she reads the wind. After a moment, very quietly: \"...The trees are afraid. Even the roots pull away from what lies below.\" She turns her pale gaze to the rest of you. \"We should not linger in the open.\"\n\n**Vaelith** saunters past them all, her tail flicking behind her as she eyes the Pickaxe & Pint with an appraising look. \"Charming. Very rustic-chic. I give it two stars — one for existing, one for having a door.\" She glances back over her shoulder, one eyebrow arched. \"Well? Shall we go meet our adoring public, darlings, or would we prefer to stand in the cold discussing *mortar composition?*\"\n\n---\n\nThe tavern door beckons, warm light spilling from its edges. Inside, you can hear the murmur of anxious voices.\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**"
