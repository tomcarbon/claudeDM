Let me set the scene.\n\n---\n\n**THE LOST MINE OF WHISPERHOLLOW**\n*What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. The late afternoon light turns grey and thin as clouds cling to the peaks above, and a cold wind funnels down through the pass carrying the smell of wet stone and old pine.\n\nYou've been walking for two days since the trading post at Millhaven, where the letter found you. Crumpled now in Bramble's coat pocket, its ink smudged by nervous fingers, the words of village elder Brenna Stonemantle still hang in the air like a bad omen: *Three gone. Ground shakes. Please come. We have nowhere else to turn.*\n\nWhisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall, then scattered cottages with dark windows, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called the Pickaxe & Pint, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. \n\nAnd beneath your feet — beneath *everything* — you feel it. A low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself. Deep. Steady. Wrong.\n\nDrak walks a few paces ahead, his copper-gloved hand resting on the haft of his handaxe. He stops, nostrils flaring. His hawk Talon circles once overhead, then settles on the well's stone rim with an uneasy flutter.\n\n\"...quiet,\" he says. Just that. One word. But his eyes are scanning the rooftops, the treeline, the shadows between buildings.\n\nBehind you, Eldon has stopped mid-stride, one hand raised, fingers splayed toward the ground. \"Fascinating. *Fascinating.* That resonance — it's not geological, or at least not *entirely* geological. The periodicity suggests — oh, are those dwarven runes on that well? Hold on, I need to — someone write this down —\"\n\nPip appears at your elbow, grinning despite the chill. \"Well now, not exactly a bustling metropolis, is it? But I can smell hearth smoke and what might be mutton stew from that tavern, and as my gran always said, any port in a storm — especially one that serves stew.\" His smile is warm, but his eyes are watchful.\n\nSister Mirael stands still at the valley's edge, her gaze lifted not to the village but to the mountainside above it. Her lips press thin. \"...the trees lean away from the peak,\" she murmurs. \"Even the roots know something is wrong here.\"\n\nVaelith adjusts her cloak with theatrical displeasure. \"Charming. Absolutely charming. A dying village, mysterious tremors, and missing persons. Tell me again why we took this job, darling?\" She glances at you sidelong, one eyebrow arched. \"Oh, right. Because we're *heroes.*\" The word drips with irony, but she's already walking toward the tavern door.\n\nThe Pickaxe & Pint's sign groans overhead. Through its grimy windows, you can see the flicker of firelight and the hunched shapes of a handful of locals nursing their drinks in heavy silence.\n\n---\n\n**Bramble** — you're here. Whisperhollow, such as it is. The tavern's right in front of you, and somewhere up that hillside, behind iron doors sealed for forty years, something is humming in the dark.\n\nLet me roll a quick **Perception check** as you take in the village square:\n\n🎲 **Perception (d20 + 0):** 15 — **Success! (DC 12)**\n\nYour thief's eyes catch it immediately — up the hillside, half-hidden by scrub brush and shadow, you can see the mine entrance. And flickering behind those massive iron doors, faint but unmistakable: **blue-white light**, pulsing in perfect rhythm with the vibrations beneath your feet. Like a heartbeat. Like something breathing down there in the dark.\n\n**What do you do?**"
