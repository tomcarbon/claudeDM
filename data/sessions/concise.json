      "text": "Now I have everything I need. Let me begin the adventure.\n\n---\n\n# The Lost Mine of Whisperhollow\n### *What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. Evening light slants through the peaks in long amber shafts, catching the dust your boots kick up and turning it to gold.\n\nYou've been walking since dawn — all six of you — bound together by circumstance, coin, and a crumpled letter that smells faintly of tallow and desperation. The letter came three days ago, finding you at Harker's Trading Post where you'd been spending your last coppers on watered-down ale and wondering which direction trouble would come from next.\n\n*\"To any souls of courage and compassion,\"* it read, in a hand that trembled. *\"The village of Whisperhollow begs your aid. The earth shakes. The mine screams. Three of our people have vanished into the dark. We have little to offer but our gratitude and our savings. Please. We have nowhere else to turn.\"*\n\nSigned, *Brenna Stonemantle, Village Elder.*\n\nAnd here you are.\n\n**Whisperhollow reveals itself gradually** — first a crumbling stone wall half-swallowed by creeping ivy, then scattered cottages with dark windows and sagging rooflines, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called **the Pickaxe & Pint**, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze like a rusty hinge begging for oil. From somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration — like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.\n\nThe village is small. Maybe two dozen structures. Half of them look abandoned.\n\nDrak stops mid-stride, his head tilting almost imperceptibly. One hand drifts to the longbow on his back. His hawk, Talon, circles overhead in a slow, watchful spiral.\n\n\"...Quiet,\" he says. Not a request. An observation.\n\nEldon nearly walks into Drak's back, his nose buried in some kind of brass instrument covered in spinning dials. \"Hmm? Oh, yes, quiet, very quiet — actually, not quiet at all, do you feel that? That subterranean resonance? Approximately 14 hertz if my tympanic oscillator is calibrated correctly, which — well, it *probably* is, I adjusted it last Tuesday, or was it Wednesday? The point is, something down there is vibrating at a frequency that suggests — oh.\" He looks up, blinking owlishly at the empty village square. \"That's rather grim, isn't it?\"\n\nPip Whistledown steps up beside you, Bramble, and gives the village a long look. Something flickers behind his warm brown eyes — recognition, maybe, of a place holding on by its fingernails. Then the grin returns, bright as a copper penny.\n\n\"Well now,\" he says, bouncing lightly on his toes, \"looks like a place that could use a good meal and some better news. What do you say, friend? Tavern first? My gran always said you can't save the world on an empty stomach — and she was right about most things, give or take her opinions on turnip wine.\"\n\nSister Mirael stands at the edge of the square, one hand resting against the well's stone rim. Her fingers trace the carvings there — old runes, nearly worn smooth. She says nothing, but her brow furrows, and her eyes drift upward toward the mountainside where, if you look carefully, you can just make out the dark shape of massive iron doors set into the rock.\n\nVaelith saunters past all of you, her tail swishing, already heading for the tavern door. \"Well, this is *charming*,\" she drawls, pulling her cloak tighter against the mountain chill. \"Haunted mine, missing villagers, mysterious vibrations — honestly, I'm surprised there isn't a fog machine. Shall we get a drink before the inevitable mortal peril, or would you all prefer to stand in the street looking dramatic? Not that I'm judging. The silhouettes are quite fetching.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Pickaxe & Pint's door is right there, warm light and the murmur of voices spilling out into the dusk. Somewhere up the hillside, those massive iron doors wait in the gathering dark.\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**\n\n> 🎲 *As you entered the village, I'll roll a Perception check for you — your sharp rogue's eyes are always working.*\n> **Perception: d20 (14) + 0 (WIS mod) + 2 (proficiency) = 16** ✅ vs DC 12\n> \n> *You notice faint blue-white light flickering behind the sealed mine doors up the hillside, pulsing in time with the vibrations beneath your feet. Whatever is down there, it's **active**.*"
