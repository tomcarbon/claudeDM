      "text": "Now I have everything I need. Let me set the scene.\n\n---\n\n# The Lost Mine of Whisperhollow\n### *What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. Whisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall half-swallowed by creeping ivy, then scattered cottages with dark windows and doors barred from the inside. The late afternoon light catches the slate rooftops at an angle that makes the whole village look like a faded painting, something from another age, slowly being erased by time and neglect.\n\nThen — the village square. An ancient well squats at its center, its stonework cracked and green with moss, dwarven runes barely visible along its inner rim. And beyond it, the only sign of life in this dying hamlet: a weathered tavern called **the Pickaxe & Pint**, its swinging sign creaking like a gallows in the mountain breeze. Warm light spills from its windows, and anxious voices carry out into the cool evening air.\n\nFrom somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration — like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.\n\nBramble, your fingers instinctively find the reassuring shapes of your lockpicks in their leather roll. Old habits. *First thing in a new place: exits, valuables, threats.* The main road in — the only road in, by the looks of it — curves back behind you into the mountain pass. No secondary route visible. One way in. One way out. That's never good.\n\nBehind you, the rest of your companions take in the scene in their own ways.\n\n**Drak** stands motionless at the edge of the square, his copper-gloved hand resting on his longbow. His hawk, Talon, circles once overhead, then settles on a broken chimney. Drak's eyes move slowly across the rooflines, the shadows between buildings, the treeline above the village. He grunts once. *Not pleased.*\n\n\"...Quiet,\" he says. Then, after a long pause: \"Wrong kind of quiet.\"\n\n**Eldon** has already wandered three steps off the path to examine the well, muttering rapidly to himself. \"Fascinating — *fascinating* — do you see these runes? Pre-collapse era, possibly even Sundering-period, the chisel work is remarkably — oh, the mortar composition alone would suggest — but yes, the village, quite right, very concerning atmosphere, noted.\"\n\n**Pip** adjusts the pack on his shoulders and takes a deep, theatrical breath of mountain air. \"Well now! Not the cheeriest little hamlet, is it? Reminds me of Bramblewood after the sheep blight — everyone walking about like the sky might fall on their heads.\" He flashes that warm, infectious grin. \"But a warm tavern's a warm tavern, and I'll bet my last copper there's a pot of something on the fire in there. Shall we, friends?\"\n\n**Sister Mirael** says nothing. She stands apart, her bare feet on the rocky ground, her eyes closed. Her fingers brush the tops of the thin mountain grass growing between the cobblestones. When she opens her eyes, there is a faint furrow in her brow.\n\n\"...The earth is uneasy here,\" she says softly. \"Something deep. Something old. The stone itself remembers.\"\n\n**Vaelith** sweeps her gaze over the village with the practiced assessment of someone sizing up a mark. \"Charming,\" she drawls, pulling her cloak tighter against the mountain chill. \"Crumbling infrastructure, no visible constabulary, and a population desperate enough to write letters to strangers begging for help. Darling, this is either a genuine crisis or the most elaborate ambush I've seen this month.\" She pauses. \"Either way — *fascinating*.\"\n\nThe letter from Elder Brenna Stonemantle crinkles in your pocket. *Three villagers missing. The ground shaking. Livestock gone mad near the old mine. Please come. We have nowhere else to turn.*\n\nThe Pickaxe & Pint's door is slightly ajar, warm light and the smell of stew drifting out. Up the hillside to the north, barely visible in the fading light, you can make out the dark shape of massive iron doors set into the mountainside — the sealed entrance to the **Ironvein Mine**. Even from here, you think you see something — a faint, bluish flicker behind those doors, gone as quickly as it appeared.\n\n---\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**\n\nYou can head into the tavern, explore the village square, investigate the well's runes, make your way up toward the mine entrance, or anything else that strikes your fancy. The evening is young, and Whisperhollow is waiting."
