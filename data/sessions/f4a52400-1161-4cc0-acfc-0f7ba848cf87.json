It was written on rough parchment in an unsteady hand, the ink smudged in places by what might have been tears:\n\n> *To any soul of courage and conscience—*\n>\n> *My name is Brenna Stonemantle, elder of Whisperhollow. Our village is dying. The ground shakes every night. Our livestock won't graze near the old mine. Three of our people went to investigate two weeks past and have not returned. We have little to offer but our savings and our gratitude, but I beg you—come. If no one does, we will have no choice but to abandon our homes and leave whatever stirs beneath the mountain unwatched.*\n>\n> *Please. We are running out of time.*\n\nYou answered the call. So did five others.\n\n---\n\n## Act 1: Echoes in the Valley\n\nThe road narrows as your small company climbs into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor closing in. The late afternoon sun has already dipped below the western ridge, plunging the path into premature twilight. A cold wind threads through the pass, carrying with it a sound that isn't quite sound—a low, rhythmic thrumming that you feel in your teeth, in the soles of your feet, in the hollow spaces behind your ribs.\n\nWhisperhollow reveals itself gradually. First a crumbling stone wall, its mortar cracked and mossy. Then scattered cottages with dark windows and sagging rooflines, their chimneys cold despite the evening chill. And finally, a modest village square dominated by an ancient well carved from a single block of pale granite. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called the **Pickaxe & Pint**, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. Warm light spills from its fogged windows, and through them, you can make out the shapes of hunched figures nursing their drinks in silence.\n\nFrom somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel it again—that low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of something vast and buried. The stones of the well hum faintly with it.\n\nDrak halts at the edge of the square, one hand raised. Talon shifts on his shoulder, feathers ruffling. The ranger's grey eyes sweep the hillside above the village, where the dark mouth of the mountainside is barely visible against the deepening sky.\n\n\"...Something wrong here,\" he says, barely above a murmur. \"Air smells like old stone. Deep earth. Shouldn't reach the surface.\"\n\nBehind you, Pip Whistledown lets out a low whistle. \"Well now,\" the halfling monk says, his usual brightness tempered with something careful, \"that's a village that's forgotten how to sleep easy, that is. Poor souls.\" He adjusts the iron pot hanging from his pack. \"Reckon they could use a hot meal almost as much as they could use our help.\"\n\nEldon's goggles are already down over his eyes, the gnome wizard cycling through lenses as he peers at the well. \"Fascinating. Do you feel that resonance? Sub-harmonic vibration, consistent periodicity—roughly forty-two beats per minute if my count is correct, which it always is. That's too regular for seismic activity. That's *mechanical*. Or...\" He trails off, a new lens clicking into place. \"...or something alive.\"\n\nSister Mirael says nothing. She stands at the edge of the square with her staff of living ivy, her amber eyes half-closed, one hand pressed flat against the stone wall beside her. After a long moment, she speaks, so quietly you almost miss it.\n\n\"...The stone is afraid.\"\n\nVaelith sweeps past all of you, adjusting the collar of her plum velvet cloak with practiced nonchalance. \"Wonderful. A dying village with a haunted mine and trembling rocks. This is exactly the sort of lucrative opportunity I was hoping for.\" She pauses at the tavern door, one eyebrow arched. \"Well? Shall we go introduce ourselves to the locals, or would you all prefer to stand in the cold listening to the mountain's heartburn?\"\n\n---\n\n**Bramble**—you stand in the village square of Whisperhollow as the last light drains from the sky. The Pickaxe & Pint beckons with its warmth and its answers. The ancient well hums beside you. And somewhere up that dark hillside, behind doors of cold iron sealed shut forty years ago, three villagers are waiting to be found—or have already stopped waiting.\n\nWhat do you do?"
