Let me set the scene.\n\n---\n\n# The Lost Mine of Whisperhollow\n### *What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. Whisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall, then scattered cottages with dark windows, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called the Pickaxe & Pint, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. From somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.\n\n---\n\nThe six of you stand at the edge of the village square, road dust still clinging to your boots. The sun hangs low behind the western peaks, painting the sky in shades of bruised purple. The letter from Brenna Stonemantle is two weeks old and already soft from being folded and refolded in Bramble's pocket.\n\nDrak stops walking. His hand drifts to Talon's jesses as the hawk shifts uneasily on his shoulder. He tilts his head, listening.\n\n\"...Wrong,\" he says quietly. \"Too quiet. No birdsong.\"\n\nEldon nearly walks into Drak's back, his nose buried in some brass contraption. \"Hmm? Oh, yes — the acoustic dampening is remarkable, actually. Subsonic vibrations at this frequency would absolutely disrupt avian — well, any small fauna, really. The resonance pattern suggests a source roughly —\" He squints at his device and points toward the dark mountainside above the village. \"— there. Give or take three hundred feet of elevation.\"\n\nPip sets down his pack and stretches, scanning the village with bright eyes. \"Well now, looks like the kind of place that could use a good meal and some cheering up, doesn't it? Reminds me of Bramblewood after the late frost — everyone too worried to remember to smile.\" His grin falters for just a moment as he eyes the shuttered windows. \"...Lot of dark windows for this hour.\"\n\nSister Mirael stands very still, her bare feet on the packed earth of the road. Her eyes are closed. \"The land grieves,\" she murmurs. \"Something below is... restless. Not angry. Sorrowful.\"\n\nVaelith adjusts her collar and surveys the village with theatrical disdain. \"Charming. Absolutely charming. I can already feel the property values plummeting.\" She glances sidelong at the group. \"So — the tavern, then? I assume we're doing the tavern. I, for one, refuse to save a village on an empty stomach.\"\n\nThe Pickaxe & Pint's door stands ajar, warm lamplight spilling across the threshold. Inside, you can hear low, anxious voices.\n\n---\n\n**Bramble** — the village stretches before you. Your trained eye has already clocked two exits from the square, the quality of the locks on the nearest doors (poor), and the general state of poverty hanging over this place like a fog. Your fingers itch with old habit.\n\nLet me make a **Perception check** for you as you take in the scene:\n\n🎲 **Perception: d20 (14) + 0 (WIS) + 2 (proficiency) = 16** — *Success! (DC 12)*\n\nUp the hillside, past the last row of cottages, you catch it — a faint blue-white light flickering behind what must be the sealed mine doors. It pulses slowly, rhythmically, in perfect time with the vibrations thrumming through the soles of your boots. Whatever is down there, it's alive. Or close enough.\n\n**What do you do?** Head into the Pickaxe & Pint? Investigate the mine entrance first? Scout the village? The others are waiting on your lead."
