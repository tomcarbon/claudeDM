Whisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall, then scattered cottages with dark windows, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called the Pickaxe & Pint, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. From somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.**\n\n---\n\nThe six of you stand at the edge of the village square as dusk settles over the valley. Bramble, the letter from Elder Stonemantle is crumpled in your pocket, its ink smudged from the road. Behind you, your companions take in the scene.\n\nDrak shifts his weight, one hand resting on the longbow across his back. His eyes move from rooftop to rooftop. \"Small place. Scared place.\" He nods toward the shuttered windows. \"They're watching us.\"\n\n\"Fascinating,\" Eldon mutters, already crouching beside the well, squinting at something along its inner rim. \"Pre-Sundering masonry if I'm not mistaken — and are those *runes*? Nobody mentioned runes. Does anyone have a magnifying—\"\n\n\"What Eldon means to say,\" Pip cuts in with a warm grin, patting the gnome on the shoulder, \"is that it's lovely to be here and we're happy to help. I can smell stew from that tavern, and my gran always said you can judge a town by its stew.\" He glances at you, Bramble. \"Shall we head in? I imagine that's where we'll find whoever's still brave enough to keep their doors open.\"\n\nVaelith adjusts the collar of her cloak, eyeing the flickering candlelight behind the tavern's windows. \"A village on the edge of abandonment, a mysterious sealed mine, and an elder begging for help. Darling, this has 'unpaid overtime' written all over it.\" She pauses. \"Still. I do love a good mystery. After you.\"\n\nSister Mirael stands apart, her head tilted slightly as if listening to something the rest of you cannot hear. After a moment she speaks, softly. \"...The earth here is troubled. Something beneath us stirs in its sleep.\" Her gaze settles on the mine entrance visible up the hillside — and for just a moment, a faint blue-white light flickers behind those massive iron doors before going dark.\n\nThe Pickaxe & Pint awaits, its door slightly ajar, the murmur of anxious voices drifting out into the cooling evening air.\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**"

      "text": "The mountain air hits your bare skin like a slap. You make it about three steps toward the tavern door before Pip clears his throat.\n\n\"So, ah... friend.\" He steps in front of you, eyes carefully fixed on your face. \"I respect the confidence. I truly do. But my gran always said, 'A halfling without his trousers is just a cold halfling with regrets.'\"\n\nVaelith arches an eyebrow. \"Well. That's certainly *an* entrance strategy, darling. Bold. Avant-garde. Deeply inadvisable.\"\n\nDrak stares at you for a long moment, then grunts and looks away.\n\nFrom inside the tavern, you hear the anxious murmur of conversation die as someone peers through the window. A muffled voice: *\"Are those the adventurers Brenna sent for?\"* A pause. *\"...Moradin's beard.\"*\n\nSister Mirael steps forward and quietly holds out your clothes. \"The night is cold, and the mountain does not care for pride.\" There's no judgment in her voice — just patience.\n\nEldon, predictably, hasn't noticed. He's still examining the well. \"These runes are *definitely* pre-Sundering. Does anyone have a piece of chalk? Anyone? No?\"\n\nThe door to the Pickaxe & Pint creaks open and a grizzled old man with a wild gray beard — Old Tormund, by the look of him — squints out at you. His expression shifts from hope to confusion to something approaching despair.\n\n\"You're the help?\" he says flatly.\n\n**You're standing in the village square, very much without your gear or armor. Your AC is currently 10 + DEX (13). Your equipment is in a pile at your feet. The tavern awaits.**\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?**"
