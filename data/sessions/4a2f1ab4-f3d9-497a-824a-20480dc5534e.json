Let me begin the adventure.\n\n---\n\n# The Lost Mine of Whisperhollow\n## *What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe letter arrived three days ago at the Waystone Trading Post, smudged with road dust and written in a trembling hand. *\"Please,\"* it read. *\"The ground shakes. The animals won't go near the old mine. Three of our people went in two weeks ago. They haven't come back. We have coin — not much — but we have need. If you are brave, come to Whisperhollow. If you are wise... come quickly.\"* — *Brenna Stonemantle, Village Elder.*\n\nThe coin wasn't much. But \"sealed mine,\" \"missing people,\" and \"strange noises\" were the kind of words that drew a certain type of person to a certain type of job. Bramble Thornfoot was exactly that type.\n\nAnd he wasn't alone.\n\nThe road had thrown them together in the way roads do — Drak Voss, the scarred ranger who walked like he was always listening for something behind him; Eldon Fairweather, the gnome who hadn't stopped talking since the first mile marker; Pip Whistledown, the halfling monk who somehow produced fresh biscuits from his pack at every rest stop; Sister Mirael, the elven druid who said less than Drak but meant more; and Vaelith Duskmantle, the tiefling warlock who'd joined the group with a smile that promised nothing and suggested everything.\n\nSix strangers. One dying village. Whatever was under that mountain.\n\n---\n\n*The road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. Whisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall, then scattered cottages with dark windows, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called the Pickaxe & Pint, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. From somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.*\n\nEvening is settling over the valley like a bruise. The air smells of wood smoke and sheep, and something else — something mineral and old, drifting up from cracks in the hard-packed earth. Every window on the main street is shuttered except the tavern's, where orange light and the murmur of anxious voices spill into the dusk.\n\nDrak stops walking. His hawk, Talon, shifts on his shoulder. One hand rests on the hilt of his shortsword.\n\n\"...Quiet,\" he says. Not a complaint. An observation.\n\n\"Quiet? *Quiet?*\" Eldon peers through his oversized spectacles at the village square. \"It's not quiet at all, actually — can you feel that? Subsonic vibration, approximately fourteen hertz if I'm not — oh, look at the stonework on that well, pre-Sundering masonry technique if I'm not mistaken, which I rarely am—\"\n\n\"He means it's *too* quiet, Eldon,\" Pip says gently, tucking a biscuit back into his pack. His smile doesn't quite hide the way his eyes are scanning the dark windows. \"The kind of quiet where everyone's hiding.\"\n\nVaelith adjusts her cloak and surveys the village with the practiced eye of someone calculating property values. \"Charming. Rustic. The sort of place where no one would hear you scream.\" A theatrical pause. \"Shall we get a drink, darlings? I suspect we'll want one before this is over.\"\n\nMirael says nothing. But her eyes drift upward, toward the mountainside, where — if you look carefully — you can just make out the dark shape of the sealed mine entrance against the rock.\n\n---\n\n**Bramble** — the village square stretches before you. The Pickaxe & Pint tavern is ahead, the ancient well stands at the center of the square, and the road continues uphill toward the mine. \n\nWhat do you do?"

The tavern it is.\n\n\"Tavern,\" Bramble says, already moving.\n\n\"Oh, *wonderful* decision,\" Vaelith purrs, falling into step. \"I was beginning to think we'd have to stand in the street and brood all evening.\"\n\nDrak grunts. Follows.\n\nThe party crosses the square and pushes through the tavern's heavy oak door into warmth and light.\n\n---\n\nThe Pickaxe & Pint is exactly what you'd expect from a mining village tavern — low-beamed ceiling hung with rusted lanterns, walls decorated with old picks, shovels, and ore samples mounted on plaques. A faded map hangs behind the bar, yellowed and curling at the edges — the Ironvein Mine tunnels, drawn in careful dwarven hand. The air is thick with pipe smoke and the smell of stew that's been on the fire too long.\n\nA dozen villagers are packed inside — far too many for a regular evening. They huddle in clusters, nursing ales and speaking in low, urgent tones. Every head turns when the door opens.\n\nSilence drops like a stone.\n\nThen a barrel-chested man behind the bar — human, bald, with forearms like hams — breaks the tension. \"Strangers. You'll be the ones answering Brenna's letter, then.\" It's not a question.\n\nA grizzled old man at the end of the bar swivels on his stool. Wild gray beard, rheumy eyes narrowed to slits. He looks your party up and down and spits into a tin cup. \"Fools, more like,\" he mutters loud enough for everyone to hear. \"More fools walking toward that cursed hole in the mountain.\"\n\nA young woman near the fire — sun-browned, early twenties, sharp hazel eyes — stands up immediately. \"Shut it, Tormund.\" She looks at your group with an intensity that borders on desperate. \"You're here to help? My brother Tam — he's one of the three who went in. He's twelve years old.\"\n\nLet me make a **Perception check** for Bramble as he takes in the room:\n\n🎲 **Perception: d20 (14) + 0 (WIS) + 2 (proficiency) = 16** — *beats DC 12!*\n\nBramble, even as you're clocking the exits (back door behind the bar, two windows on the east wall, root cellar trapdoor behind the barkeep's feet), your sharp eyes catch something else: up the hillside, visible through the tavern's front window, faint **blue-white light flickers behind the sealed mine doors**, pulsing in a slow rhythm. It's perfectly in sync with the vibration you feel through the floorboards.\n\nWhatever's in that mine, it's *breathing*.\n\nPip has already found his way to the young woman. \"We're here, friend. We'll find your Tam.\" His voice is warm and sure. He takes her hand. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Elara,\" she says. \"Elara Windmere.\"\n\nEldon has drifted toward the map behind the bar, muttering and tracing tunnel lines with one finger. Mirael stands near the door, arms folded, watching the room like she's reading the forest floor for tracks. Drak leans against the wall in the darkest corner, Talon preening on his shoulder, his eyes on Old Tormund.\n\nVaelith is already at the bar. \"Whatever passes for wine here, darling. And information. In that order.\"\n\n---\n\nThe barkeep, the old man Tormund, and the young shepherd Elara are all watching you, Bramble. The room is waiting to see what kind of people answered their letter.\n\n**What do you do?** You could talk to Elara about the missing villagers, press Tormund for his \"curse\" story, ask the barkeep about that map, or something else entirely — this is your show."

And what exactly were they thinking?\"\n\nElara's jaw tightens. She sits back down by the fire and gestures for Bramble to join her.\n\n\"Two weeks ago. Tam, Haldor the carpenter, and Miri — she's the blacksmith's daughter. The tremors had been getting worse, and the noises...\" She shakes her head. \"You can hear them at night. Like grinding metal. Rhythmic. Haldor said it sounded like someone was *working* down there.\"\n\nShe leans forward. \"They took rope, torches, and Haldor's tools. Said they'd just look through the doors — the welds have been cracking for months now. Warm air comes through the gaps. They left at dawn.\" A pause. \"They didn't come back by nightfall. Or the next day. Or the next.\"\n\n\"Anyone go after them?\" Bramble asks.\n\n\"Brenna forbade it. Said she'd sent for help.\" Elara's hands ball into fists on her knees. \"Two *weeks*, sitting here while my brother is—\" She stops. Breathes. \"Their bedrolls and a broken lantern are still at the mine doors. They got inside. But there's no blood, no signs of a fight. They just... went in.\"\n\nPip, who's been listening quietly, puts a hand on her shoulder. \"No blood's a good sign, friend. Means there's every reason to hope.\"\n\nFrom the end of the bar, Old Tormund lets out a bitter laugh. \"Hope! *Hope*, he says.\" The old man lurches off his stool and jabs a gnarled finger toward your group. \"You want to know where they went? Same place my brother Aldric went forty years ago. *Into the mountain.* And the mountain doesn't give people back.\"\n\nHis voice drops, rough with old grief. \"They sealed those doors for a reason. Welded 'em shut, warded 'em with dwarf-magic. You think they did that because everything was *fine* down there?\" He shakes his head. \"There's something in that mine. Something that *whispers*. Aldric heard it. The miners all heard it. And then they closed the doors and *never spoke of it again.*\"\n\n🎲 **Insight check on Tormund — d20 (11) + 0 (WIS) = 11**\n\nHard to tell if the old man is genuinely afraid or just drunk and dramatic. Probably both.\n\n\"Oh, how *delightfully* ominous,\" Vaelith murmurs into her wine cup.\n\nDrak speaks up from his dark corner, his low voice cutting through the noise like a knife. \"...The three who went in. They bring weapons?\"\n\nElara shakes her head. \"A hand axe. That's it. They weren't expecting a fight.\"\n\nDrak's eyes meet Bramble's across the room. One slow nod. The message is clear: *unarmed, no signs of violence, two weeks gone. Either they're dead or they're trapped.*\n\nEldon has detached himself from the map long enough to raise a finger. \"Quick question — the noises, the grinding metal sounds — did they start *before* the welds began cracking, or after? Because if the seals weakening is what triggered the — oh, and also, does anyone know what that blue-silver ore in the mine is called? Because if it's what I *think* it is—\"\n\n\"*After,*\" Elara says firmly. \"The cracks came first. Then the noises.\"\n\nEldon's eyes go wide behind his spectacles. \"Fascinating. So the containment breach preceded the activity. That suggests a reactive system, not an aggressive one. Whatever is down there, it woke up *because* the seals are failing, not the other way around. Which means—\"\n\n\"Which means,\" Mirael says softly from the doorway, and everyone goes quiet, \"it was sleeping. And now it is afraid.\"\n\nA silence settles over the tavern. The floorboards hum.\n\n---\n\nYou've got a clearer picture now, Bramble. Three missing villagers — unarmed, gone two weeks, no signs of violence. Cracking seals woke something up. Tormund thinks it's a curse; Eldon thinks it's a security system; Mirael thinks it's scared.\n\nThere's also **that map behind the bar**, Brenna Stonemantle herself (who Elara says lives in a cottage behind the shrine), and the **mine entrance** up the hill.\n\n**What's your move?**"

Can I get a look?\"\n\nThe barkeep — who introduces himself as **Garrick** — pulls the yellowed parchment off its nail and spreads it across the bar top, weighing down the curling corners with ale mugs.\n\n\"Drawn by the miners themselves, back when the Ironvein was still running. My da kept it when the mine closed. Figured someone might need it someday.\"\n\nEldon materializes at Bramble's elbow so fast it's like he teleported. \"Oh, *oh* — yes, this is excellent, look at the shaft geometry, classic dwarven radial layout with — may I? Thank you — primary descent here, ventilation shafts here and here, and—\"\n\n🎲 **Investigation check for Bramble — d20 (17) + 1 (INT) + 2 (proficiency) = 20**\n\nBramble's eyes aren't on the engineering. They're on the *gaps*.\n\nYou lean over the map and your thief's instincts kick in — you've broken into enough buildings to know when a floor plan doesn't add up. The map shows:\n\n- A **main entrance** leading to an **antechamber** and guard post\n- **Upper tunnels** branching into a maze of mining shafts, with a large **supply room** marked off the main junction\n- Rail lines running deeper, converging at what's labeled **\"LOWER ACCESS — SEALED\"**\n- Beyond that... nothing. The map just *stops*.\n\nBut here's what your sharp eyes catch: there are **dead-end tunnels on the map that don't make sense**. Two shafts on the eastern side terminate abruptly at what should be solid rock — but the ore vein markings *continue past the wall*. Miners don't stop digging when the ore keeps going. Not unless there's something behind that wall they didn't want on the map.\n\n**Hidden passages.** At least two of them.\n\n\"Eldon,\" you say quietly. \"These shafts here—\"\n\n\"Yes! Exactly!\" The gnome bounces on his toes. \"Truncated excavations with continuous ore signatures — either they hit structural instability, which is unlikely given the surrounding geology, or—\"\n\n\"Or they hid something.\"\n\nEldon grins. \"I *knew* I liked you.\"\n\nDrak has drifted over, looking at the map over Bramble's head. One copper-gloved finger taps the main junction where three tunnels meet. \"Bottleneck. Good place for a fight.\" A pause. \"Good place for a trap.\"\n\nVaelith peers at the blank space beyond \"LOWER ACCESS — SEALED\" and raises an eyebrow. \"How convenient that the map simply... ends. I do so love walking blind into the bowels of a mountain. Keeps the skin youthful.\"\n\nMirael studies the map briefly, then looks at Bramble. \"The map shows where they *worked*. It does not show where they *prayed*.\" She taps the supply room. \"A community that seals itself underground keeps its provisions close... and its sacred places closer.\"\n\n---\n\n**What you know from the map:**\n- Main entrance → antechamber → upper tunnel network\n- Supply room off the main junction (the missing villagers likely headed here)\n- At least **two hidden passages** on the east side the map doesn't account for\n- A sealed lower access point leading to... somewhere the mapmakers didn't want recorded\n- Rail lines that could be used for quick movement deeper in\n\nGarrick folds his arms. \"You're welcome to take it with you. Won't do anyone good hanging on my wall.\"\n\nThe night is deepening outside. The floorboards hum. Elara watches you from beside the fire, chewing her lip.\n\n**You could head to the mine now, visit Brenna Stonemantle at the shrine first, rest for the night and leave at dawn, or something else. What's the plan, Bramble?**"

My gran always said you don't start a hard bake with a cold oven.\" He smiles. \"Speaking of which — Garrick, what's in that stew?\"\n\n---\n\n## Long Rest at the Pickaxe & Pint\n\nGarrick puts the party up in the tavern's two cramped rooms above the bar — free of charge, on Brenna's orders. The beds are lumpy and the walls are thin, but it's warm and dry.\n\nSleep comes unevenly.\n\nAt some point past midnight, you're jolted awake by a **tremor**. The whole building shudders. Dust sifts from the ceiling beams. Your ale mug rattles off the nightstand and shatters on the floor. Through the window, you see that faint blue-white light on the hillside flare bright for three heartbeats, then fade.\n\nThen silence. The deep hum resumes, slower now, like something settling back to sleep.\n\nFrom the next room, Eldon's muffled voice: \"Fourteen hertz! I *told* you! Everyone felt that, yes? Tell me someone is *writing this down*—\"\n\n\"Go to *sleep*, Eldon,\" Vaelith groans through the wall.\n\nEventually, you do.\n\n---\n\n## Dawn in Whisperhollow\n\nMorning comes gray and cold. Mist clings to the valley like cobwebs. The party gathers downstairs where Pip has — somehow, impossibly — commandeered Garrick's kitchen and produced a breakfast of fried eggs, toasted bread, and herbed potatoes.\n\n\"Bit of wild rosemary from the hillside,\" he says cheerfully, sliding a plate in front of Bramble. \"Found it on the walk in yesterday. Lovely what grows up here.\"\n\nDrak eats in silence, already dressed and armed. Talon tears strips of dried meat on the windowsill.\n\n**All HP restored. Long rest complete.**\n\nNow — supplies. Whisperhollow isn't exactly a market town, but you ask around and find what's available:\n\n**Available in Whisperhollow:**\n\n| Item | Price | Source |\n|------|-------|--------|\n| Torches (bundle of 6) | 1 sp | Garrick |\n| Rope, 50 ft (hempen) | 1 gp | Elara's barn |\n| Rations (3 days) | 1 gp 5 sp | Garrick |\n| Candles (10) | 1 sp | Brenna's shrine |\n| Oil flasks (3) | 3 sp | Garrick |\n| Pitons (10) | 5 sp | Left behind by the miners, Garrick's storeroom |\n| Chalk (3 pieces) | 3 cp | Eldon already has some, offers to share |\n\nElara also reminds you: \"There's **fifty feet of rope** at the mine entrance with the missing villagers' gear. And their torches and tinderbox.\"\n\n**Bramble, you currently have 10 gp in your belt pouch.** The other party members can chip in for shared supplies.\n\nMirael speaks up, her voice quiet but pointed. \"Before we go to the mine... should we not speak with Brenna Stonemantle? She sealed the letter. She knows more than she has said.\" Her gaze is steady. \"People who send for help and then hide behind shrines are usually guarding secrets, not just prayers.\"\n\nDrak nods once. \"...Agreed.\"\n\n---\n\n**What do you want to buy, and do you want to visit Brenna at the shrine before heading to the mine?**"

The shrine is simple — rough-hewn walls carved with the stern bearded face of Moradin, the dwarven god of the forge. Candles flicker around a plain stone altar inside, their light steady despite the morning breeze.\n\n*Brenna leads you to the shrine, her weathered hands clasped in front of her. She's shorter than you expected — stout, silver-haired, with deep lines etched by decades of mountain wind and worry. A well-worn holy symbol of Moradin hangs from her belt, and her fingers find it the moment she turns to face you.*\n\n*\"My grandmother sealed that mine,\" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. \"She never told us why — only that some things are worth more than gold, and some doors are closed out of love, not fear.\" She glances at the altar stone, and you notice fresh scratches around its edges, as if someone has recently tried to move it.*\n\nMirael's eyes fix on the scratches immediately. Drak notices too — his gaze flicks to Bramble.\n\nBramble, those scratches are practically screaming at you. Someone's been trying to pry that altar stone up. Recently.\n\n**Do you want to ask Brenna about it, try to persuade her to share more, or investigate the altar yourself?**"

The pages are brittle but legible, covered in tight, precise script.\n\nIt's written in **Dwarvish**.\n\nBramble stares at the angular runes. Not a word of it means anything to him.\n\n\"Eldon.\"\n\nThe gnome is already there, practically vibrating. \"Oh — oh *my* — yes, this is Old Formal Dwarvish, pre-reformation orthography, absolutely beautiful penmanship—\"\n\n\"*Eldon.* What does it *say*?\"\n\n\"Right, right, yes.\" His eyes scan the pages rapidly, lips moving. The excitement drains from his face, replaced by something quieter. Something like awe.\n\nHe reads aloud:\n\n> *\"The vein led us to something that was not ore. A geode of golden light, warm to the touch, humming with the voice of the Soulforger himself. We knew at once what it was. A shard of Moradin's power, left in the bones of the world. The Heart of the Mountain.*\n> \n> *It must never be moved. It must never be claimed. To remove it would be to pull the keystone from an arch — the mountain would fall, and all it shelters with it.*\n> \n> *We seal the mine not out of fear, but out of love.

I will seal the doors behind him and keep this secret until I am dust.*\n> \n> *Moradin forgive me. I could not talk him out of it.\"*\n\nSilence.\n\nBrenna Stonemantle is weeping. Quietly, the way people do when grief is so old it's worn smooth.\n\n\"Thrain,\" she breathes. \"My grandfather. They told me he died in a collapse.

He turns away to give Brenna her moment.\n\nDrak stares at the floor. His copper-gloved hand flexes once.\n\nVaelith, for perhaps the first time since you've known her, has nothing to say. She studies a candle flame with sudden, intense interest.\n\n---\n\nBramble, you now know the truth. The mine wasn't sealed to keep something dangerous *in*. It was sealed to keep the world *out*. And the thing lurking down there — the shadow, the noises, the tremors — that's likely **Thrain Stonemantle himself**, still keeping his vigil after forty years. Alone. In the dark.\n\nBrenna wipes her eyes and straightens. \"Find him,\" she says, and her voice is iron. \"Find my grandfather.

If anything down there remembers him... this might help.\"\n\n*(Silver holy symbol of Moradin — worth 15 gp, but potentially far more valuable in the mine.)*\n\nThe party climbs the hill in silence. The morning mist thickens as you ascend, the village falling away below until Whisperhollow looks like a collection of toy houses in a gray cotton bowl. The path is overgrown — nobody's walked it regularly in decades — but Drak finds the trail without breaking stride, Talon gliding ahead through the fog.\n\nThen the mist parts, and you see it.\n\n---\n\n*The mine entrance looms before you, set into the mountainside like a wound in the rock. Two massive iron doors, green with age and webbed with cracks in their ancient welds, stand as the last barrier between the village and whatever stirs below. Dwarven runes circle the door frame in an unbroken ring, their edges still sharp despite decades of weathering. As you approach, the vibration in the ground intensifies, and the runes begin to glow with a faint blue-silver light, as if responding to your presence. Three bedrolls and a shattered lantern lie abandoned at the door's base — the missing villagers made it this far.*\n\nThe air seeping through the cracked welds is warm and smells of old stone and something faintly metallic. Bioluminescent lichen grows in the cracks, pulsing with a slow, rhythmic glow. Like a heartbeat.\n\nDrak crouches by the abandoned bedrolls. Examines them without touching. \"...Two weeks of weather on these. No blood.\" He looks at the gap in the doors. \"Squeezed through. All three.\"\n\nBramble, the crack in the welds is wide enough for a halfling to slip through sideways — but not the others. The doors need to be properly opened.\n\nEldon is already examining the rune circle, nose practically pressed to the iron. \"Ward sequence! Protective, not destructive — this is designed to *lock*, not to harm. The activation pattern should follow standard Moradinian liturgical order, which means—\" He traces the runes with a finger, muttering. \"Hammer, anvil, flame, stone, hammer, anvil...\"\n\n🎲 **Arcana check (Eldon) — d20 (15) + 3 (INT) + 2 (proficiency) = 20** — *beats DC 13!*\n\nEldon spins around, grinning. \"I've got it! The runes are a prayer sequence — Moradin's Hammer Strikes. You trace them in liturgical order: forge-fire, shape-stone, cool-water, temper-will.\" He pauses. \"Or... we could also just use that holy symbol you're carrying. A consecrated focus of Moradin should resonate with the ward and — may I?\"\n\nHe takes the silver symbol from Bramble and presses it against the central rune. The entire circle flares **brilliant blue-white**. A deep, resonant *clang* echoes through the mountain — the sound of a hammer striking an anvil, impossibly loud, rolling down through stone and into the deep places of the earth.\n\nThe welds crack. The doors groan. And slowly, with the grinding protest of forty years of rust, the iron doors of the Ironvein Mine swing open.\n\nStale air rushes out — warm, mineral-heavy, carrying the faintest trace of something that might be incense or might be decay. Beyond the threshold, darkness. Your torchlight catches the edges of an antechamber: overturned crates, a collapsed guard post, rusted equipment scattered across the floor.\n\nAnd from deep, deep below — that rhythmic grinding sound. Metal on stone. Something still working in the dark.\n\nDrak draws his shortsword. Talon launches from his shoulder and perches on the door frame, refusing to enter.\n\n\"...Bird's got sense,\" Drak mutters.\n\nVaelith peers into the darkness. \"Well. After you, darlings.\" She pauses. \"Way, *way* after you.\"\n\nPip lights a torch and holds it high. The cheerful mask is still on, but his stance has shifted — weight on the balls of his feet, shoulders loose. Ready.\n\nMirael touches the stone doorframe gently, as though greeting it. \"The mountain is listening,\" she says quietly. \"Tread carefully.\"\n\n---\n\n**You're at the threshold of the Ironvein Mine, Bramble.** The antechamber stretches ahead, cluttered with debris. You can see overturned crates and rusted mining equipment — and you hear the faint skittering of small clawed feet somewhere in the shadows.\n\n**What do you do? Scout ahead with your Stealth, send the party in together, investigate the antechamber carefully, or something else?**"

He looks at Eldon. \"What's the word?\"\n\nEldon practically bounces. \"*Mellon* — no wait, that's elvish, completely different linguistic root — the Dwarvish word for 'friend' is *khazad-akar*. Or more precisely, 'trusted-of-the-forge.' Try to get the glottal stop right, it's important—\"\n\n\"Just say it for me, Eldon.\"\n\n\"Right! Yes. Follow my lead.\"\n\nBramble steps around the corner into the junction, holy symbol raised in one hand, the other hand open and empty at his side. Every instinct he has is screaming at him to duck behind cover. He ignores them.\n\nThe pickaxes snap toward him instantly. They hover, heads raised like cobras, edges gleaming. The mining cart lurches forward on its rails with a metallic shriek, closing half the distance before stopping. Waiting.\n\nBramble holds his ground.\n\nEldon steps out beside him, clears his throat, and speaks in clear, formal Dwarvish:\n\n**\"*Khazad-akar. Voldur Moradin. Tharek-zul.*\"**\n\n*Friend. By Moradin's will. We come in peace.*\n\nHe holds up the holy symbol higher. The silver catches the blue glow of the ore veins and blazes white.\n\n🎲 **The holy symbol of Moradin is presented and the Dwarvish word for friend is spoken — this meets the conditions for the guardians to stand down!**\n\nFor one terrible second, nothing happens. The pickaxes tremble in the air. The cart creaks forward another inch.\n\nThen — a sound. Deep in the metal. A low harmonic tone, like a tuning fork struck inside the earth. The runes on the stone door behind the guardians flare blue-white. The blue-silver ore in the walls pulses once, brilliantly.\n\nThe pickaxes lower. Slowly, gently, like tired arms finally allowed to rest. They drift to the ground and clatter against the stone floor, inert. The mining cart rolls backward to its original position and goes still, just a rusted piece of old equipment again.\n\nSilence. True silence, for the first time in the mine.\n\nEldon lets out a breath he's been holding for approximately forty-five seconds. \"Oh thank every god in every pantheon, I was about *sixty* percent sure that would work—\"\n\n\"*Sixty?*\" Vaelith hisses from behind the corner.\n\n\"Well, sixty-five. The glottal stop was tricky.\"\n\nPip laughs — a real laugh, bright and warm, and it fills the tunnel like sunlight. \"Bramble! Diplomacy! Look at you!\"\n\nDrak steps into the junction, surveys the dormant tools, and nods once. \"...Good call.\" Coming from Drak, that's practically a standing ovation.\n\nMirael moves past them all and kneels beside one of the fallen pickaxes. She touches it gently. \"Forty years,\" she murmurs. \"Forty years of faithful service. Rest now.\"\n\n---\n\nThe junction is clear. And the **second rune lock** on the stone door awaits — the passage to the lower levels and the underground river beyond.\n\nEldon is already examining it, fingers tracing the carved runes. \"Same ward system as the entrance, but more complex. A sequential activation puzzle. I need a moment—\"\n\n🎲 **Investigation check (Bramble) on the supply room walls — d20 (15) + 1 (INT) + 2 (proficiency) = 18** — *beats DC 15!*\n\nWhile Eldon works, Bramble's eyes drift to the walls of the side chamber where the villagers were trapped. Scratched into the stone in clumsy letters — Haldor's work, from the look of it — are **partial notes**. The carpenter had been studying the rune lock from a distance, trying to work out the sequence. He didn't finish, but what he mapped gives Eldon a crucial head start.\n\n\"Bramble! These markings — oh, this is *excellent*, the carpenter was no fool — look, he'd already identified the third and fifth positions in the sequence. That gives me—\"\n\n🎲 **Arcana check (Eldon, with advantage from Haldor's notes) — d20 (8, 16) + 5 = 21** — *beats DC 14!*\n\nEldon's fingers dance across the runes. They light in sequence — blue, silver, blue, gold, silver — and the stone door shudders. Dust cascades from its frame. A deep, resonant *boom* rolls through the tunnel, and the door grinds open, revealing a **spiraling passage** descending into darkness.\n\nCold air rises from below. And with it, a new sound — not grinding metal, but the rush of **moving water**. Distant. Deep.\n\n\"The underground river,\" Mirael says. \"We're close.\"\n\nThe spiral passage descends before you, carved with careful dwarven precision, the blue-silver ore veins glowing brighter the deeper they go. The air smells of cold stone and clean water.\n\n**Deeper, Bramble?**"

It reverberates off the carved dwarven stonework and rolls into the deep like a small thunderclap.\n\nEveryone freezes.\n\nFrom somewhere far below, the echo comes back — distorted, multiplied, bouncing off stone and water until it sounds almost like a response.\n\nPip covers his mouth, eyes watering with suppressed laughter.\n\nDrak closes his eyes. Opens them. Says nothing. But the copper glove creaks as his fist tightens.\n\n\"Charming,\" Vaelith says flatly. \"Truly. The dwarves carved these halls over generations, and *that* is what echoes through them for the first time in forty years.\"\n\nEldon tilts his head. \"Actually, the acoustic properties are *fascinating* — the spiral geometry creates a natural amplification chamber. That was probably audible for at least—\"\n\n\"Eldon. *Please* stop calculating.\"\n\nMirael stares at Bramble. A long, elven silence. The kind that makes you feel like a sapling being judged by an ancient oak.\n\n\"...The mountain is *still* listening,\" she says.\n\n🎲 **Rolling for consequences of loud noise in unstable tunnels — d20 (16).** The ceiling holds. Lucky.\n\nDrak starts walking down the spiral passage. Doesn't look back.\n\n\"...Moving.\"\n\n**The party descends. Deeper, Bramble?**"
