Let me set the scene.\n\n---\n\n# The Lost Mine of Whisperhollow\n### *What Was Sealed Below Was Never Meant to Be Forgotten*\n\n---\n\nThe road narrows as you climb into the valley, the mountains pressing close on either side like the walls of a corridor. Whisperhollow reveals itself gradually — first a crumbling stone wall, then scattered cottages with dark windows, and finally a modest village square dominated by an ancient well. The only sign of life is a weathered tavern called the Pickaxe & Pint, its swinging sign creaking in the mountain breeze. From somewhere deep in the earth beneath your feet, you feel more than hear a low, rhythmic vibration, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.\n\n---\n\nThe evening air smells of sheep dung, cold stone, and something else — a faint mineral tang drifting down from the hillside where the dark shape of a sealed mine entrance hunches against the rock like a wound that never healed.\n\nYour companions fan out beside you on the road. Drak is already crouched, one knee in the dirt, his copper-gloved hand pressed flat against the ground. He's been doing that every few hundred yards since the tremors started. Talon, his hawk, circles high and silent above the rooftops.\n\n\"Ground's humming,\" he says. Nothing else.\n\nEldon nearly walks into Drak's back, his nose buried in a folded parchment — the letter from Brenna Stonemantle that brought you all here. \"Fascinating, fascinating — *nightly tremors*, she says, and livestock refusing to graze near the mine. Classic seismic resonance pattern, possibly amplified by subterranean crystalline structures, or — oh!\" He looks up, blinking at the village. \"We're here already? Quaint. Very quaint. Is that dwarven masonry on the well? Pre-Sundering, if I'm not — someone should really stabilize that mortar before—\"\n\n\"It's lovely,\" Pip interrupts warmly, hitching his pack higher on his small shoulders. He takes a deep breath and grins. \"Smells like home. Well — sheep and hearth-smoke, anyway. That's close enough.\" He glances at you, Bramble, and winks. \"Bet they've got a decent stew in that tavern. Nothing settles the nerves like a good stew, that's what Gran always said.\"\n\nSister Mirael stands apart, her gaze not on the village but on the treeline above it. Her fingers trace the bark of a trailside birch absently. \"...The trees are uneasy,\" she murmurs. \"Their roots feel something below. Something that should be sleeping... but isn't.\"\n\nAnd then there's Vaelith, leaning against a fencepost with studied nonchalance, examining her nails. \"Charming little deathtrap of a village, isn't it? Mysterious noises, missing persons, an elder who can only afford to pay in *meager savings*.\" She sighs theatrically. \"Remind me again why I agreed to this, darlings? Was it the promise of glory? The sparkling company?\" A pause. \"...It was the sparkling company, wasn't it. Fine. Let's go get cursed.\"\n\nThe Pickaxe & Pint's door hangs slightly ajar, warm light spilling out. You can hear voices inside — low, worried, and numerous. The whole village seems to be gathered in there.\n\nLet me make a quick **Perception check** for you, Bramble, as you take in the scene:\n\n🎲 **Perception: d20 (14) + 0 (WIS mod) + 2 (proficiency) = 16** — *Success! (DC 12)*\n\nYour rogue's eye catches it immediately — up the hillside, past the last row of dark cottages, the sealed mine entrance is just visible in the fading light. And there, bleeding through the cracks around those massive iron doors: a faint **blue-white light**, pulsing in slow, steady rhythm. Perfectly in time with the vibration under your feet.\n\nWhatever's down there, it has a heartbeat.\n\n---\n\n**What do you do, Bramble?** The tavern door beckons with warmth and information. The mine looms above with cold answers. And the village holds its breath around you."
