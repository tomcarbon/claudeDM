    "description": "Thornfield is a hardscrabble logging village on the edge of the Wyldwood, an ancient primeval forest of towering oaks, dense undergrowth, and perpetual green twilight. The village survives by harvesting timber from the forest's edges, but the loggers have recently pushed deeper than ever before, driven by a lucrative contract with a distant city's shipwrights. The Wyldwood has responded — or something within it has.",
    "atmosphere": "An oppressive tension hangs between the village and the forest like a bowstring drawn taut. Thornfield's buildings are ringed by freshly sharpened stake walls and smoky bonfires that burn all night, while the Wyldwood presses close with an almost sentient malice, its treeline seeming to creep closer each morning. The howling of wolves echoes through every night, closer and bolder than any natural pack behavior, and the livestock pens grow emptier with each dawn.",

As they track the wolves into the primeval Wyldwood, they discover the attacks are being orchestrated by Aisling, a druid who has been using magic to direct the wolves against the village in retaliation for the loggers' destruction of sacred forest groves. However, her magic has corrupted the wolves beyond her control, turning protectors into predators. The party must navigate a complex moral situation where both sides have legitimate grievances, confront the corrupted wolf pack, and find a resolution that addresses the druid's concerns and the village's needs without simply choosing a side to destroy.",
  "hook": "The party encounters a desperate logger named Bran stumbling along a forest road, bleeding from wolf bites and wild-eyed with terror. He babbles about wolves that moved like soldiers, surrounded the logging camp in coordinated formations, and destroyed everything before retreating into the forest in perfect unison. He begs the party to help Thornfield, offering the village's meager bounty of 75 gold pieces for proof that the wolf threat has been eliminated. As he speaks, a long, low howl rises from the treeline — impossibly close, impossibly coordinated with two others, forming a chord of sound that is beautiful and terrifying in equal measure.",

When the loggers began cutting the sacred groves, she exhausted peaceful options before turning to magic in desperation.

She is horrified by the suffering she has caused and terrified that if she stops, the sacred groves will be destroyed and the Wyldwood will die."

A compromise establishes a model of sustainable forestry that could spread to other logging communities, while Aisling becomes an ally and the Wyldwood a place of refuge. A violent resolution against the druid sets the Wyldwood on a path of slow death, with ecological consequences that may not manifest for months but will eventually devastate the region. Siding entirely with the druid forces Thornfield to relocate, scattering its families and creating resentment toward druidic circles in the area. Word of the party's actions will reach the merchant who brokered the logging contract, who will not be pleased by any outcome that reduces his timber supply."
  },
  "twists": [
    "The wolf attacks are not natural predation but are orchestrated by a corrupted druid, Aisling, who is using magic to direct the wolves against the village in retaliation for the loggers' destruction of sacred forest groves.",
    "Aisling's corruption of the wolves was unintentional — her magic was meant to make them territorial, not aggressive. She is as horrified by the violence as the villagers, but feels she cannot stop without abandoning the forest to destruction.",
    "The loggers are not evil but are genuinely unaware that the forest they are cutting is sacred and ecologically critical. They were told by an outside merchant that the Wyldwood was unclaimed land, and the logging contract represents their best chance at economic survival.",
    "The adventure has no clean moral resolution. Both sides have legitimate grievances, and the party must navigate genuine moral complexity rather than simply identifying and defeating a villain."
  ],
  "dmTips": [
    "Use the survival mechanics to reinforce the Wyldwood's hostility without making them punishing. The foraging DC 12 and navigation DC 13 checks should feel like meaningful choices — do you spend time foraging and risk losing the trail, or push on hungry? — rather than arbitrary obstacles. Failing a navigation check should cost time, not cause the party to become hopelessly lost.",
    "Play Aisling with genuine emotion. She should not be a cackling villain or a serene sage — she is a young woman in over her head, exhausted, frightened, and carrying the guilt of people she has hurt while trying to save something she loves. If the party shows empathy, she should respond with desperate gratitude. If they show hostility, she should respond with desperate defiance.",
    "The moral choice is the adventure's climax, not the combat encounters. Give the party time to debate their options and explore the consequences of each path. If they ask for more information to make their decision, provide it through Aisling, Wenna, or environmental observations. Do not rush them toward a resolution.",
    "If the party refuses to engage with the moral complexity and simply kills Aisling, do not punish them mechanically, but do show consequences narratively. The grove begins to wither, the spring dries up, and on their way back to the village, they notice the forest has gone silent — no birds, no insects, no wind in the leaves. Something irreplaceable has been lost, and the forest knows it.",
    "Bran serves as a foil for nuanced decision-making. His aggressive, black-and-white worldview should contrast with the party's growing understanding of the situation's complexity. If the party brings Aisling to the village, Bran may need to be physically restrained, creating a tense scene that tests the party's commitment to their chosen resolution."
