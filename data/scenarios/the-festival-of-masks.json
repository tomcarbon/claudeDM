    "description": "A prosperous coastal trading city built on a series of limestone terraces descending to a bustling harbor, Saltmere is famous for its annual Festival of Masks — a three-day celebration where citizens and visitors don elaborate masks and revel in anonymity. The city's winding streets are draped in colored silks, its canals strung with paper lanterns, and every square hosts musicians, acrobats, and merchant stalls selling exotic wares from distant shores.",
    "atmosphere": "The festival transforms Saltmere into a kaleidoscope of color, sound, and misdirection, where identities blur and secrets travel freely behind painted facades. Laughter echoes through narrow alleyways alongside whispered conspiracies, and the ever-present scent of sea salt mingles with roasting spices and floral perfumes. Beneath the celebration's joyful surface, however, runs an undercurrent of tension — old rivalries, trade disputes, and political maneuvering all intensify when faces are hidden and tongues loosed by festival wine.",

The party is drawn into the investigation, interviewing four suspects with alibis, motives, and secrets of their own. As they peel back layers of deception, they discover the shocking truth: the 'victim' faked his own death as part of an elaborate scheme to steal the relic, frame a rival, and disappear with a new identity. The adventure culminates in a dramatic chase through the festival crowds as the party races to catch Voss before he escapes the city.",

Captain Reva Ashford, recognizing the party as capable outsiders untainted by local politics, deputizes them on the spot and asks them to investigate before the trail goes cold amid the festival chaos.

Use the festival environment actively — fireworks creating bursts of light and shadow, masked crowds that part and reform like waves, musicians whose songs create a surreal soundtrack to the chase.

Above you, fireworks paint the sky in crimson and gold, their reflections shattering across the canal's surface like broken stained glass. Voss drives the pole into the water with desperate strength, the gondola picking up speed as it shoots toward the harbor mouth and the open sea beyond. Other gondolas crowd the canal — festival boats strung with lanterns and packed with celebrating couples — forming a maze of hulls and oars between you and the fleeing merchant.\"",

The key clues needed to solve the mystery are: the staged blood (Medicine DC 14), the theatrical dagger (Investigation DC 13), the forged documents (from Serek or the warehouse), and the false alibi (from Cora). If the party has at least three of these four, they should be able to piece together the truth.",
    "If the party gets stuck, use Cora Tidewatcher as a pressure valve. Have her seek the party out, wracked with guilt, and offer partial information that nudges them toward the warehouse. Alternatively, Captain Ashford can share that the 'body' has disappeared from the morgue, raising obvious questions.",
    "The chase scene in Act 3 should use a skill challenge format: require 5 successes before 3 failures to catch Voss before he reaches the harbor. Each round, a different party member can attempt a relevant skill check against the listed DCs. Failures mean Voss gains ground and may escape entirely, forcing the party to track him to Dunmere in a potential follow-up adventure.",
    "Play up the Festival of Masks as a thematic element. Everyone is wearing a metaphorical mask in this adventure: Voss is masking his survival, the temple is masking the relic's true nature, Cora is masking her guilt, and each suspect is masking their own secrets. Let the players feel clever when they see through the disguises.",
    "The moral complexity of this adventure is its strength. Voss is a villain but a sympathetic one — a desperate man who hurt no one physically. Cora is an accomplice but a victim of circumstance. The temple is a victim of theft but also perpetrating a fraud. Let the party navigate these gray areas without imposing a single 'correct' resolution."
